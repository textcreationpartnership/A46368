            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT cannot (God be thanked) be said, that there is any need of multiplying Books of this nature, because we have such Plenty of them ready to our hands: But certainly, there may be (and, I question not, is) made great use both of their <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>Diversity;</hi> for 'tis almost the same with the Food of the <hi>Soul,</hi> at it is with that of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42872:4"/> the end of all mens eating is indeed the same, namely, the preservation of their Life and Health; but neither are their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs or Digestions equal and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and therefore they consult their several Appetites. To be devoutly minded, is (or should be) the end and aim of all men, but the ways to come to it are just as many, and as different, as the Tempers, Humors, Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Constitutions of men are; and therefore <hi>different</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of, and Helps to, Devotion, will be always <hi>useful,</hi> if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>necessary.</hi> There is a <hi>Milk</hi> for Infants in <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as in <hi>Years,</hi> and there is stronger Meat for stronger Stomachs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:42872:4"/>
            <p>I am as well persuaded, as I can be in a Matter of this nature, that nothing ever was composed more sutable to the Tempers and Affections of Mankind in general, that more consulteth the Desires and Needs of humane Nature, or is better fitted to promote an <hi>equal, regular,</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, than our <hi>Book of Common Prayer:</hi> And yet this has not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred many excellent and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Persons of our Church, both <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>living,</hi> from composing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesser <hi>Manuals,</hi> or larger Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, both for their own and for the publick Use and Service: And all of them have had their several Followers and Admirers; and all of them have had their blessed Fruits: which may not only serve
<pb facs="tcp:42872:5"/> for an <hi>Excuse</hi> for <hi>putting out,</hi> but also for an <hi>Encouragement</hi> to the <hi>reading</hi> of this <hi>Treatise of Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fame and Reputation of its <hi>Author,</hi> with the multitude of its <hi>Editions,</hi> may recommend the purchasing this Book to them that otherwise know it not; but the good Spirit it is written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al has made it dear and valuable to them that do; and the good Grace of God, I hope, will make it serviceable to all that meet with it. It is to no great purpose to account to the publick, for the Translating and setting forth this Book at this season; no Reasons will be good enough, if it do not answer the ends of a Book of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and if it do, there will be need of none. 'Tis easier for
<pb facs="tcp:42872:5"/> me to believe it will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all good People; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Presumption of some merit, to be bold to ask the Reader these few Favours, for letting him have this Book in <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That neither this nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Treatise of Devotion</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his frequenting of the <hi>publick Prayers</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> There is a most peculiar <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Comeliness</hi> in those <hi>Assemblings,</hi> which, by <hi>absenting,</hi> is <hi>deform'd.</hi> And who would chuse to spoil that <hi>Beauty of Holiness,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires so sweetly to the raising up the Soul to God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding Devotion? And who would lose the merit of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where the Commands of our Superiors in the Church are
<pb facs="tcp:42872:6"/> so reasonable, the Performances so easie, and the Fruits so profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? And lastly, who can tell the uncommon force of those col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and united Prayers; or, for a little matter, would deprive himself of the Benefit of that Conjunction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he would use great Moderation, Prudence and Discretion, in his <hi>Judgments</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Devotion; that he would not be vainly puffed up in his Imaginations, and think himself <hi>truly devout,</hi> when he sometimes feels within himself those <hi>Ardors, Transports</hi> and <hi>Elevations</hi> of Soul he may meet withal, in <hi>this</hi> or any other <hi>Treatise of Devotion;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he also find himself thereby influenc'd to a <hi>steady, close,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:42872:6"/>
               <hi>constant</hi> Practice of the Duties both of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>reveal'd</hi> Religion. For otherwise, he may chance unhappily to acquiesce in the meer <hi>Mechanism</hi> of Nature, or the light Effects of some poor, short-liv'd, accidental Cause; and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the impetuous Heats of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a strong Imagination, for the benign and gentle Warmths of true Devotion, that constantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite men to some <hi>good Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That if he find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self already in Possession (as it were) of a <hi>constant, regular</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> practice of his Duty in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other particular, he would not be too much dejected and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate, if he do not <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> feel those Ardencies and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb facs="tcp:42872:7"/> of Soul he may sometimes have had himself, have often heard of from others, and always found in <hi>Manuals of Devotion.</hi> Let him thank God for, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with (for the present) that happy state whereunto he has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and not lie down in Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Despair, for what he has not reach'd. The Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Grace</hi> upon the <hi>Soul</hi> are no more the same in all men, than those of <hi>Nature</hi> are upon the <hi>Body.</hi> The good Spirit of God blows (like the Wind) both <hi>where</hi> and <hi>how</hi> it lists; always in <hi>Mercy</hi> where it does blow, but not in <hi>Judgment</hi> always where it bloweth not, or is absent, as to its extraordinary Influences. The Extasies of Devotion are most
<pb facs="tcp:42872:7"/> unquestionably sweet and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them that feel them; but are certainly no farther useful than they contribute to the bettering and amending of our Lives, and to the improvement of some Grace and Vertue: and a constant tenour of good Practice is a more secure and more desireable state than any unequal visionary one, and being caught sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third Heavens. Yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he would not lazily rest himself in the dry, je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june Performance of the practick part of his Duty, without aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring towards Heaven and raising up his Soul to God, by frequent Contemplation. I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to acquit him (in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Article) from endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:42872:8"/> this with all his might, by all the reasonable and usual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of attaining it: but, that he should not be overwhelm'd with Grief or sad Sollicitude, if, after having done his best, he find his Heart more cold and unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Devotion, than he look'd for, or desired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That he would not rashly judge or measure <hi>other mens</hi> Devotion by <hi>his own;</hi> or superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liously condemn and scorn the Ways and Methods other men pursue the same <hi>End</hi> by, because they fall not in exactly with <hi>his</hi> private one. It is great odds, but many things within this Book will appear too fine and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to one; to another inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and hardly practicable to
<pb facs="tcp:42872:8"/> a third; but there are others to whom they will seem neither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> That he would daily put up this good Prayer to God; <hi>That the Course of this World may be so peaceably ordered by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance, that his Church may joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully serve him in all godly quietness, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> What Devotion is.</head>
                  <p>DEVOTION is not a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be defin'd, according to Rules; it belongs more properly to the Closet than the Schools, and pious Souls, though ignorant, will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42872:14"/> instruct us better in the matter, than the most learned ones, that have no Conscience. But however, the Schools that concern themselves with every thing, have undertaken to define De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as well as all the rest: some of them, by, <hi>a tender Mollification of the heart, and a mind that is mov'd:</hi> others, by, <hi>that inward Consolation that the faithful feel in their exercises of piety:</hi> others say it is, <hi>that Joy and readiness of heart, with which the Saints are carried to the Service of God.</hi> Some make it to consist, in Pleasures incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable and full of glory, that fill the Saints, and make them say, <hi>My soul is satisfied, as it were with marrow and fatness:</hi> and others in Desires and Longings. Upon all this I say, it may, perhaps, be rashness to attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine what we cannot well express; for this is of the number of those things that cannot well be conceived, but by those that feel it, or if conceived, yet cannot be sufficiently set forth: at least it cannot be defin'd by any one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42872:14"/> word, or any single movement of the Soul; for 'tis it self a Compound of the several kinds of movements, and is made up of very different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Senses: it has its Desires and its Distrusts, Hopes and Fears, Love and Hatred, Joy and Sorrow, Ardor, Zeal, Alacrity and Transports. It has Desires; for every Soul truly devout, does earnestly desire to be at peace, and one with God. <hi>When shall I enter there</hi> (says she) <hi>and appear before the presence of God? As the Hart desireth the Water brooks, so lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth my Soul after thee, O God.</hi> It has its Distrusts; for a good Soul is in perpetual fear of being unworthy to possess those graces it desires so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly; she cries, with the Centurion, to our Lord, <hi>I am not worthy thou should'st enter under my roof;</hi> and if she is in possession of her God, she is afraid of losing him, and watches even whilst she sleeps, lest any thing should take from her, her well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. There is also Fear in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42872:15"/> of this Vertue; for when a Soul is fallen into any grievous sin, the presence of God amazes her, and she is terrified at his great Majesty; and even in Innocence, a Soul truly devout, never presents it self before its God, without remembring, that the Angels tremble in his presence, and saying, <hi>Oh how dreadful is this place, surely the Lord is in it!</hi> Love also has its share, and one may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most say, Love is the source and spring of all Devotion: in considering both the beauty and the goodness of God, the Soul is moved with a violent desire and longing after union with him, and cries out with the Spouse, <hi>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for his love is pleasanter than wine.</hi> Hatred also will come in; for a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul cannot love God, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the love of it self, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the World, whose love is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with that of God. Joy also is a great Ingredient in this composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore the Wise man saith,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42872:15"/>
                     <hi>The heart of the just is a continual feast; Thou hast put more joy into my heart,</hi> says David, <hi>than the wicked have in their abundance. My heart rejoyced, and my tongue was glad, therefore my soul shall rest in peace.</hi> But yet we must own, this Light is not altogether pure and unmixt, Devotion has its Sadnesses amidst its Joys, and oftimes sighs at the remembrance of its infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and failings. In fine, a very lively Readiness and Ardor enters in and seems to be the body of Devotion, and is that which appears most in a faithful Soul. She has inconceivable Pleasure and Transports also in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Piety, she hears the Word, she prays, she reads, she meditates and communicates, just as she does the things of the world she most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in. She flies to these perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances with abundance of joy, and performs them with abundance of ease. These are, I think, the movements that make up Devotion; but we must needs remember that they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42872:16"/> in the same degree, even in the same persons. Some of these Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are always uppermost; at one time Joy prevails, and at another Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; sometimes great Transports, and at others, Longings. And hence it comes, if you consult the Saints about the nature of Devotion, that they will give you very different Answers; for all will tell you what they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and each of them perhaps has differing Sentiments. And sometimes too, it happens that one and the same Soul finds her Devotion different at several times, each of the foresaid movements reigning in its turn; to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day a Christian shall be full of hope of some great good in prospect, tomorrow full of joy for the possession of it: to day, reigns sadness for his sins, and at another time desires and longings: and all these changes hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen according to the several states and conditions in which the Soul finds it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self, and according to the different prospects Meditation furnishes it with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42872:16"/> all; considering God sometimes, with respect to his Love and Mercy, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with respect to his Severity and Justice: sometimes also he will look on his Conscience on that side where 'tis strongliest fortified, and sometimes where 'tis weakest, and this will cause a change in the movements of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: Lightness and Joy it self, which seems to be the very soul of Devotion, is not always inseparable from it; for sometimes the best of Souls find themselves clog'd, and dull, and very sad, but when the heavy Fit is over, and lightsomness returns again, they find themselves sharply aggrieved for having wanted it at all.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Effects of Devotion.</head>
                  <p>IN speaking of the nature of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the foregoing Chapter, we have insinuated all its Effects; but it may not be unprofitable to enlarge our selves a little farther hereupon; these Effects well understood will lead us to the knowledge of their Cause,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42872:18"/> and will serve as a touch-stone, as it were, for the good Souls to try there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the purity and progress of their Devotion. The first of these effects, is a vehement desire of conversing with God, and pouring out its sorrows and concerns into his bosom; of hearing his Word, and receiving the Gages of his love in his most holy Sacraments. You see these movements in <hi>David</hi> when he sighed after Gods house, and thought nothing more insupportable in all his exile, than his being remov'd <hi>from the Courts of the Lords house:</hi> he is jealous even of the Swallows blest condition, that find themselves a nest therein: he would be Porter to that house, and be content never to leave it. <hi>My soul,</hi> says he, <hi>longeth after thy Courts; One thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd of God, which I will require, even that I may dwell in the house of God all the days of my life:</hi> he owns that the hopes of meeting with God again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his house, supported him from falling into despair, <hi>I should utterly have faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42872:18"/> if I had not verily believed to have seen the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> A faithful Soul hath no less passionate desires to be in private with her God, than <hi>David</hi> had to be with him in publick in his Temple: she looks upon all time as lost that she is oblig'd to give unto the World, and when she can break loose from its affairs, she runs into Gods bosom, as the dry Hart unto the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-brooks; as the sad Miser to the search of gain, or as the Courtier, at the hour and place, to see his Prince, and to be seen, and to receive of him considerable favours.</p>
                  <p>The second Effect, is a Joy that we may call inconceivable: the Faithful in his Devotions feels his heart enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; the Holy Ghost dwells there with all the riches of his grace, and all the treasures of his consolations. He that shall ask this Soul, why she is so content, it may be, shall receive no answer from her; but the true cause of it is this, that God has spread abroad
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42872:19"/> in her his sweet and saving influences, that are accompanied continually with full Felicity. The Pleasure that the Miser finds in counting up his Riches, the Ambitious tastes in hoping for new Honors, or the Voluptuous find in his Excesses and Debauches, are dull insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid pleasures in comparison of those a Soul truly devout finds in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with God. It is a Sea where all the troubles and afflictions of the flesh are overwhelmed; the persecuted find their refuge there, the poor their wealth, the sick their health, the despis'd their glory, the humble ones their exaltation; in a word, the most miserable find a general forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of all their miseries: 'tis there a soul disgusted with the world, meets with that true repose that makes him look without envy, and even with pity, on the cruel agitations of those Worldlings that are fastned to <hi>Ixion</hi>'s Wheels, and <hi>Sisyphus</hi>'s stones; that is, those restless labours that return per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, and never know an end.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42872:19"/>
                  <p>And hence proceeds a third Effect of Devotion, and that is, a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the World: when the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful shuts his Closet-door we may say he shuts his door to all the World; and says within himself, get ye behind me worldly Thoughts, Objects of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity withdraw, and come not near me in this place: let me enjoy in peace this place of Refuge, and let me here entirely give my self to God: The faithful dies on this sort every day, for Death it self not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces worldly Images, than does De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, when it withdraws a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Soul out of the Commerce of the World. This Soul can truly say, <hi>The world is crucified to me and I to it, it is not I that live, but Jesus Christ my Lord that liveth in me; and the life that I live, is in the faith of the Son of God, that hath loved me, and given himself a ransom for me.</hi> We need not wonder if the World gives place that very moment, for I suppose 'twill find but little entertainment in a Soul
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42872:20"/> prepared as I have been describing. God will take up this heart, of which he hitherto possessed but a share, for a heart truly devout, plunges it self (if we may speak so) wholly into God, and God for his part wholly enters into it. If, in this state, he casts his Eyes upon the World, he looks upon it as below, and with an air of contempt. Alas, says he, what are the Riches, Honours, and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that do so often end in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting death, to the Riches God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords me here within, nay to my God himself whom I possess with so much pleasure? these earthly goods shall soon be lost, but I shall never lose this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign good, that filleth me within; and Death that shall despoil the living of their Pomp, shall cloath me with new Honours, and fresh Glories.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Effect, is Sprightliness and lively Joy in running and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the exercises of Piety. A Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of an Army flies to the Battel, when he sees the Conquest certain;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42872:20"/> but the faithful One has other sort of wings, that make him fly whither Devotion calls him: he knows not what that Heaviness and Languor means, that keeps back those who are called to labour; he is not of the slothful's mind, that turns upon his Bed, as a door upon it's hinges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with sleep and laziness, with design to be overcome. The true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, is one of those Eagles, of which our Lord spoke, <hi>where the Carcase is, thither also will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> He knows that he shall find his Saviour, dead heretofore, but now alive, either within the Temple, or his Closet; thither he flies with the rapidity of an hungry Eagle, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing possibly can stop his course; Friends, Enemies, Employs, Business, Intreaties, Threatnings, Fears, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he will surmount all Obstacles, that set themselves to hinder him.</p>
                  <p>Another Effect, is a certain Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Soul, that I can find no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name for, than a kind of Extasie,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42872:21"/> by which the Soul is ravish'd, as it were out of its self; it is so fixt on Contemplation of celestial Objects, that it not only has no farther intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with earthly things, but it has also lost its Senses, has no more Ears, nor Eyes, and neither sees nor hears any longer. S. <hi>Peter</hi> whilst he prayed, saw the Heavens open'd, and a Sheet tied at four corners, let down to the Earth: S. <hi>Paul</hi> in prayer was ravish'd up to the third Heaven: and true Devout ones have even to this day their Extasies: they see the Heavens opened with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and they are carried thither with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for they enter into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Commerce and Intelligence with God: The Soul is so taken up here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that she sees nothing of what passes without, and employing all her might in contemplating upon God, it is not strange if she has nothing left for other Objects. <hi>Blessed are those</hi> (saith great S. <hi>Basil) that are wholly busied in contemplating this true Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for being fastned there, by the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42872:21"/> bonds of Charity and heavenly Love, they forget both their Relations and their Friends, their Houses and their Goods, and even the necessities of Meat and Drink.</hi> And why should not this be done in matters of Devotion, as well as in every thing besides? When men are very intent on Reading, clearing an Accompt, answering an Adversary, or the like, a thousand Objects pass before their Eyes, which they perceive not: a faithful Soul is so included and collected in itself, that 'tis not easily diverted by whatsoever passes: if it prays, it is wholly in Heaven; if it hears, it is wholly fixt in suspence on the Tongue of the Speaker; if it reads, its Heart is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where its Eyes are set; if it medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, it is wholly swallowed up in its Subject? and if the fluttering Birds, vain light Thoughts, come in to defile the Sacrifice, it does immediately, like <hi>Abraham,</hi> drive them away with Anger. Thus I explain, and thus conceive the Extasies of Devotion. If
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42872:22"/> you will otherwise take that term for those effectual Ravishments, that were the privileges of the Prophets, and the Saints of the first rank, I should hardly think there were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of that nature to be found; I have not faith enough to believe what is said of those Devotions, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate not only Souls, but even Bodies from the Earth, and carry them to the Clouds.</p>
                  <p>The last effect of Devotion, of which I will speak, is a certain kind of Fire that warms and heats the Heart. One cannot well conceive this thing, that has not felt it, and I cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise give it you, than in the words of the Saints: <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us whilst he talked with us, and opened the Scriptures? My heart was hot within me, while I was musing, the fire burned, and at the last I spake with my tongue.</hi> They say the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Souls have oft been seen, with their countenances as it were infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amidst their Devotions, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42872:22"/> must needs proceed from the heat of their hearts, that spreads and shews it self upon the Face. One may call this Fire a fermentation of the spirits of Piety, which oftentimes makes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, even in the Eyes: and hence it may be, came that brightness of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> of whom it is said, his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <hi>saw his face, as it had been the face of an Angel,</hi> his flaming zeal spreading it self even to his Eyes, and making them appear sparkling and full of fire and Glory. These Flashes also are not without their Showers; this Fire, I mean, is ordinarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with tears, the Heart is heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, swells and grows big, and breaks in tenderness, and then the Eyes flow with their tears. S. <hi>Austine</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents himself in one of these warm Fits, and says, <hi>After strong Meditation had drawn out all my misery from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom where it was hid to represent it to the Eyes of my Heart, there was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly raised a mighty storm and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest in me, which was followed by an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42872:23"/> excessive shower of tears.</hi> These Tears proceed not always from sorrow for sin, but are sometimes caused by a struggling of thoughts, and a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of good motions, that throw the Soul into a kind of a disorder, which yet is sweeter, and much better than the greatest Calm.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That Devotion is very necessary.</head>
                  <p>NO Man can doubt of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Devotion, that does but understand, or can express in any tolerable measure, what it is: Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Soul of the Soul, and life of Piety; 'tis that which gives the price and value to the exercises and divine worship of a good Soul; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations are necessary to every thing. The Orator that is to speak in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick gathers first his matter, and then essays to put it in good form: A Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that must fight, prepares his Arms and calls his courage up: and he that's going to a Nuptial Feast, puts on his best attire. Why then should we present our selves to God by Prayer, by Reading, or by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word, seeking his Aid, or rendring him our Thanks, without the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42872:25"/> holy and preparatory dispositions of true Piety, that are of so great value in his sight? We always do that well, which we do heartily; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done to any purpose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we make our selves parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; the Soldier that carries not his heart along with him to fight, will turn his back before the Battel ends: and the Orator whose mind is not touch'd with what he says himself, will never move another. If therefore works of the Tongue and Hand, will signifie so little without the Heart, how shall the Heart alas do any thing without it self? 'Tis thus I call the exercise of Piety and the Service of God. Can a Lute play that is not scrued and set, or can a Bow be drawn that is not bent and strung? The heart of Man is as an Instrument or Lute, whose Musick charms the very Ears of God, but then it must be tun'd with all its Vertues, as so many strings, and Devotion must be as it were a kind of Soul to move and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42872:25"/> all the rest. Prayer is a Dart that flies to Heaven, but 'tis Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only gives it strength and wings. Prayer is a Sacrifice, the Calves of the Lips, and offering of the Heart. One should not willingly present to God the common Victims, without choice and without preparation; the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb was separated from the rest of the flock four days before it was sacrific'd. Offer not then to God your Prayers cold and impure, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate your Hearts from all these worldly Vanities, and from the croud of sinful thoughts, if you would have it acceptable in the sight of God.</p>
                  <p>Dead is the Soul without Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the heart a very carcase; what rashness were it then to lay a dead, corrupted Beast before Gods sacred Altars? Will he not say to those inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Souls, I hate, I despise your Feast-days, I will not regard the Peace-Offerings of your fat Beasts, nor the sweet Perfumes and Incense that you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42872:26"/> offer me, I cannot bear them. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is a Fire without which our Sacrifices cannot be consum'd, nor made perfect: 'tis a Fire that comes down from Heaven, and an emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rays of the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and that that must carry up to Heaven the smoke of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense. Believe it Christians, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Devotion our Prayers will falter by the way, and will be never able to penetrate those thick gross Clouds of Errors and of Sins that part us from our God. The matter that makes up those heavy massy Thunderbolts, could never have ascended up into the middle region of the Air, had they not once been carried up upon the Wings of some enflamed Exhalations. So neither can our Hearts, our earthly Prayers ascend to Heaven, unless the flames of strong Devotion bear them up.</p>
                  <p>I return therefore to this, that we ought to put our Hearts in good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that we may look for good
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42872:26"/> success upon our serving God: and yet all the preparation we can make of our hearts will never make them good enough for him, to whom we offer them. He will do us a very great favour, if he accept of them even in their best condition. What therefore can we look for but a shameful sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal, if we offer him an undevout Soul? God does not hear mens Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if the heart be not well dispos'd to make them. <hi>Seek and ye shall find,</hi> says our Lord, but seek earnestly, for otherwise you shall not find. It is but once that God hath said, <hi>I was found of them that sought me not:</hi> This does not happen every day; these are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Events which make no Rules; the common Law is this, <hi>Ask and it shall be given,</hi> take the Kingdom of Heaven by violence, and thou shalt obtain it.</p>
                  <p>For what is not Devotion good? it is of use in all places, at all times, and in all things, in Churches and in Closets: by it we hear the Word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42872:27"/> by men, but, as it truly is, the Word of God, and we receive it as the parched ground takes in the Rain. By it the consideration of Gods benefits affects us, the remembrance of his Love inflames us, his Promises comfort, his Threats amaze us, and his Consolations work upon our hearts. Without this, the Word which should be as a two-edg'd Sword is blunted on the hardness of our heart; and without this we add the crime of Insensibility to that of Impenitence. By this we look on every thing within the Church with veneration, the Preacher as the Messenger of God, his Word as a voice from Heaven, the Faithful as Gods Children, and as so many troops of Angels that rejoice in his presence; his Sacraments as precious Vessels which to appearance are contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, but which communicate the treasures of Gods grace and mercy. This true Devotion makes our Closets little Temples, where the Divinity descends, and over which he spreads
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42872:27"/> his Wings as the Cherubim did theirs over the Propitiatory. This Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion causes God to speak to us, as we to him; and makes us hear his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and tast his Consolations, when he says, <hi>Son,</hi> or Daughter, <hi>be of good courage, arise, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> Oh happy Soul whom God thus honours with these blessed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments. Now this is never done but by ardent Devotion; till we have called upon him, nay till we have forced him in some measure to it. These desires of Devotion may well be those Eyes of which the Spouse speaks, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me.</hi> Hence ye profane Ones, that know not the use of Devotion. You say that Courage is the Rampart of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, the publick and the private Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: that Liberality sweetens the Misfortunes of the miserable; that Justice is the Nurse of Peace and bond of Society, that Temperance gives tranquillity to the Soul and health to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42872:28"/> the Body, but that Devotion of all Vertues is good for just nothing, that it effeminates the Soul and intimidates the Mind. Call not that Universal Vertue useless without which all the rest are but as shadows; for he that has not a habit of Devotion, and refers not all his Vertues to the glory of God, is a false Virtuoso. Call not that Vertue useless that appeases the wrath of God, that diverts the storms and tempests from Estates; that would have rescued <hi>Sodom</hi> from the Fire, had there but been ten righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in it, that like <hi>Abraham</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly interceded for it. A Vertue that so often saves the Vessel of the Church from Shipwrack, that fills the Conscience with profound Peace and heavenly Light. Say not that it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates Souls, when it raises and strengthens mens hearts and makes them run to Death, despise Dangers, and spare nothing in occasions, where the glory of God calls and engages them.</p>

                     <p>Behold then, one of the causes of my Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; one of the reasons why my Soul has so little devotion is this, that it comprehends not sufficiently the necessity of this great Vertue. It knows that Aliments are necessary to the conservation of the Body, and therefore it desires them with great earnestness, and seeks for them with wondrous diligence: but it is negligent of every thing that serves to nourish Piety and Devotion, because it believes not them to be either necessary or useful. Thou seest, O my Soul, abundance of People save themselves by a dead and faint Devotion, and go to Heaven by very slow steps, and thou persuadest thy self that God will not be more rigorous to thee, or exact more of thee than of others; but oh, this is a false and fatal way of reasoning! He whom thou thinkest is in the way to Heaven, is in the way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to Hell. <hi>There is a way that seemeth right in the sight of men, but the issues of it tend to death.</hi> These coldnesses with which thou thinkest God content, are always insignificant; 'twill be but cold comfort to be able one day to say, We have prayed to thee, we have call'd upon thee, we have serv'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42872:29"/> thee; when our Lord shall notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answer, <hi>I know not who ye are, go hence, depart from me, ye that are neither cold nor hot, I spew you out of my mouth.</hi>

Light of my Soul, thou heavenly Spirit, that hast illuminated thy Church and Faithful in all Ages, inspire in me such sentiments of true Devotion, as I most certainly know are necessary to the saving of my Soul, and without which I cannot but be hopeless of thy favour. Kindle my heart, and let it be an

                  <p>THE rarity of Devotion is an exception to that general Rule, that says, <hi>Things rare are always much valued.</hi> There is nothing rarer in the World than true Devotion, yet nothing more neglected. Men do not offend in this point, through ignorance, they very well know that without a devout disposition, it is impossible our Prayers should please God. But yet 'tis hard to express the fearful Negligence with which men do this exercise of Piety, as well as all the rest. They come to it with a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42872:30"/> prodigious slowness; 'tis plainly Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and not Inclination draws them to it; 'tis Fear of blows and punishment that makes them march like Slaves, as to a work of pain and difficulty: 'tis what we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our wills, and as little of it as is possible. If we steal a quarter of an hour from the World, to give it to God, we persuade our selves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, we are excellent good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; when we are at Prayers, we make all hast to have done quickly, as tho 'twere something troublesom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to us; and when we have done we think we are at ease again. Can that be well, that is done thus? Or how can we pray to God as we should, when we consider not what 'tis we are to ask? When we would pray, we ought to represent to our selves with all respect and lowliness the Majesty of him, before whom we are to appear; so that we come not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an hasty inconsiderate way, as though we were to speak to some
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42872:30"/> mean Man. If we observe it well, the Body is upon the Mountain, when the heart is yet in <hi>Sodom;</hi> the Mind is wandring round the World and roam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even in imaginary spaces, divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self with fansiful and empty Speculations. The greatest part of us turn our Prayers over our Tongues, and let them run like a stream, but the Heart has little or no share in them, and if it has, the impression is so weak, that within a moments space it perfectly disappears. And should we when we rise from our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but examine if our Faith, our Hope, or Charity have received any considerable increase, we should be certainly confounded with shame; but alas, we think of nothing less than such Enquiries; we run immediately where Interest or Pleasure calls, and think no farther on the Duty. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the greatest part, after their Prayers, may find their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in a worse condition than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; so that this examination instead
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42872:31"/> of producing Peace should augment their disquiets; and if their Prayers be indevout, what are the rest of their Performances? If when we hear the Word of God, we give any attention, 'tis rather to the way of speaking them, than to the things themselves. If the Preacher hath not the gift of pleasing, we do not hear nor edifie at all; there's nothing, we say, that can keep us awake, and then we think we may sleep the Sermon out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so much as hurting the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all. And thus we speak to men that are deaf, and our Churches from whence we have banish'd Images, are yet fill'd with Idols, <hi>that have eyes and see not, and ears that hear not.</hi> The Preacher seems to have <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusa</hi>'s Head in his hands, that when he appears turns all to Marble, and the Word of God is a Charm that maketh Stones of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, instead of making <hi>Abraham</hi> Children out of Stones. A great part of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers remember nothing else than what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42872:31"/> they think the worst, to furnish mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for their Censures or profane wits; an excellent thing is quite neglected, but an unlucky one is soon recovered; that is, in a fair Field richly adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they gather here a Thorn, and there a Leaf, and overlook the Flowers and Fruit. Those that do least evil in this way, hear, and would fain make good use of what they hear; but 'tis alas but an imperfect Will, that does not long abide, but almost ends together with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But oh, what indevotion and what coldness is there not, in parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Lords Supper, that vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sacrament wherein Christ distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to us his Flesh to eat and his Blood to drink! Piety is not now divided into a croud of different Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Worships, as it was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the Law, but is reduc'd to two or three Ceremonies, and to One Sacrament for grown up Persons. We should therefore recollect all our Devotion upon this Occasion, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42872:32"/> give to this sole Gage of Gods Love all that zeal and ardor that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were oblig'd to shew in all the several Services commanded by the Law. A Flame that's scattered burns but little, the Rays of the Sun at large, heat but indifferently, but when collected in the Centre of a Burning-glass, they burn up Wood and melt down Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. It would be so if our Devotion could unite in this divine Object, it might consume all our Vanities, and melt down all the Ice and cold affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Soul; if we were but truly devout in the participation of this holy Sacrament, our Faith would penetrate through all appearances and contemptible outsides, to contemplate on, within, the broken Body of the Son of God, and all the Mysteries of our Salvation. But here we stop at what we see, and come as it were to an ordinary Meal, and bring our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion thither, and carry nothing thence but Condemnation.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42872:32"/>
                  <p>By what we see in Publick, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture at what is done in private, and 'tis a hard matter to judge fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of the Devotions of the Closet, when there is so little reason to be satisfied with what we see in Churches: if nothing is done for glory and the pleasure of being approved and prais'd; to what degrees will not zeal relax, when there shall be no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses at all? Let us not then be thought to violate the Rights of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, if we say that private Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more carelesly perform'd than publick Ones: for without doubt he that sleeps at Sermon will hardly keep awake at simple Reading, where the Words want Sound, and Voice, and Tone to hinder men from sleeping. But every Man on Earth ('tis said) has his fault, and all Conditions have their failings. The Tradesman is for Gain, and covetous, and oftentimes a Cheat: The Courtier is Ambitious: the Magistrate is corrupt: the Poor impatient; and the Rich ones Proud.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42872:33"/> But we may say that Indevotion is the fault of all <hi>professions</hi> in the World; and one would say of all <hi>Men,</hi> if by the grace of God there were not yet some good Souls, that sigh in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for the evil state of others, and themselves, that pour out their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows before God with abundance of Zeal, and that delight in his Sabbaths and Service. But alas, how rare are such Examples! it may be we shall hardly find ten such as these in <hi>Sodom:</hi> and since Exceptions overthrow not Rules, we cannot but cry out on this our Age, as on an Age of Ice and Iron.</p>

                     <p>I am called to examine other men; I see very well that Devotion is very rare in the World. This ought to trouble me exceedingly for the share I have my self in Gods Interests. This ought to terrifie me not a little, that the whole World become not Universal <hi>Sodom,</hi> or be made like <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and God should pour his vengeance on it, in Deluges and storms of Fire and Brimstone. But there is

How is it possible it should remain insensible amidst so many Objects that are capable of moving it? How can it prove unthankful, when encompass'd with so many of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? How is it that it does not tremble before him, whose presence even the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels tremble at?

How often have I quarrel'd with my Heart, and said within my self, Oh wretched heart, why dost not thou tremble within me? Why art thou not afraid of him, whom thou canst never fear enough? Why dost not thou love him infinitely who infinitely hath lov'd thee?

                     <p>Thou seest, alas, my God, thou seest how I lament and sigh beneath the burthen of my corruption and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion. Ah help me to defeat my self of them, to the end the motions of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Zeal thou lovest so dearly may be as frequent for the time to come as hitherto they have been rare. Let them no more resemble those poor sparks that rise at a great distance from an keap of Embers that are now cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and extinguishing; but let them be as those pure flames that burn continually, even in the midst of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and may withstand the storms and tempests of Temptation, of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and of ill Examples. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of suffering me to be born away by the floods of Corruption and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion that flow even in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary it self, let my Piety shine forth, I pray thee, as a bright Lamp amidst the darkness of this World.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That Indevotion is a greater Fault, than we think for.</head>
                  <p>I Speak not of the Indevotion of the Profane, but of theirs that would be call'd Gods Children. I speak of those Negligences, cold Distractions, and vain sensual Thoughts that cross their exercises of Devotion. That which makes this Fault so common is, the Opinion men have, that 'tis so very small, and so inevitable, that 'tis not needful to take any great care to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or prevent it. There is nothing but is said and thought on to excuse and flatter ones self in this fault. We say 'tis the nature of the Soul to be active and stirring, that it cannot fix upon one Object, that Thoughts fly out and vent themselves, then, when we think to hold them strongliest in; It is we say, the distemper of the Soul,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42872:35"/> and which it is not to be blamed for. Now though it were an Evil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together involuntary, yet sure it were but reasonable to deplore our Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in that it is so: 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a mark of an irregular Soul, and a proof that sin hath caused terrible disorders there. If you should see a man, in the midst of a Discourse full of good Sense, break out upon the sudden, and say a thousand Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, you would say undoubtedly his mind was mightily disorder'd; and is it not a proof the heart is so too, when you perceive that it is carried off amidst its devout Thoughts, and all upon the sudden rambles from its Subject, and itself, to lose it self in a thousand wild Chimerical Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? But besides all this, I say, there is a fault as well as a misfortune in this mischief: 'tis enough to know that Sin is the cause of this disorder, to rest assur'd that there is sin in having and in suffering it. The Production of so criminal a Cause cannot be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42872:35"/> I own, that the lower part of the Soul, corrupted by sin is like the Fenny-grounds, where Vapours rise continually and are sometimes so thick that they obscure the Sun it self. Our Passions, it is true, raise clouds of vain and evil Thoughts, that hinder us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from seeing our great Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. But what then? do's it follow hence, that this is no great evil? All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crimes flow from this Source, but are they therefore the less Crimes?</p>
                  <p>We imagine that the Mind of Man cannot fix, but this is false, and a thousand Experiences convince us it is so. Were you to plead before some Mighty Prince in behalf of your Life, you would think so steadily thereon that you would think of nothing else, and when you spoke would suffer no distractions. When a covetous Man is counting up his Monies, he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear you when you knock at his Closet door. A man that is taken up with some important Business, and has set his heart thereon, finds no such
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42872:36"/> wild distractions of Imagination. In a word, we can sit whole days atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to hear a Comedy, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else we like as well. It would not therefore be so hard, would we but try in right good earnest, to put a stop to this lightness of Spirit, of which we complain, as though it were an evil incurable. But in this Vice of Indevotion, there is a certain pride of Heart that will not suffer us to be throughly humbled before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whose presence universal Nature trembles.</p>
                  <p>I would fain know if a King would take it well, that in doing him. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a man should turn his back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and do him homage with an air of disdain? yet this is that we do continually to God. We do not give him half our hearts. Can it be thought a little sin, to despise and neglect him whom the Angels worship? <hi>The Lord is King, let the Earth stand in awe,</hi> is what we seldom think, or say to our selves; and because God
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42872:36"/> does not speedily avenge the outrage done his Majesty, we get a habit of neglecting him, without concern or fear.</p>
                  <p>Were there no other thing in Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but the Crime of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 'twere enough to make us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the severest Punishment. We know very well that God commands Respect, Ardor and Zeal; we cannot but remember, we are call'd upon, to take the Kingdom of Heaven by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; we hear say every day, <hi>he spews the lukewarm out of his mouth;</hi> we read every where, that the life of the faithful ought to be a swift Race, and no slow pace; and we know he would have us eaten up with the zeal of his House: Yet to the prejudice of all these Orders, if not in their defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we are disrespectful, cold and languid. Ah, who shall be obey'd, if God is not? He who maketh the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Spirits, and his Ministers a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Fire; he who hath so many means to avenge him of his Rebels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42872:37"/> the Obedient, and whose Commands are always just, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways holy!</p>
                  <p>Tell me not then, this Want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the exercises of Devotion, is a slight fault, it is a most assured proof we love not God. 'Tis not at this rate we pursue the things of this World, <hi>Seek for Wisdom as for Silver, and search for her as hidden Treasures, with all diligence,</hi> says the Wise man. Oh, would to God that we could make a change of Thoughts, and give those to this World which we have for heavenly things, and those we have for heavenly things, unto this World. Is it not a Crime, do we think, not greatly to abhor the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God that Ardor, and Attention, and Engagement that we have for the things of this life? A Fault that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of God, is no slight thing; a Fault that robs us of the divine Consolations is not to be neglected or despis'd. 'Tis by this Fault it comes, that we so little feel the sweetnesses
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42872:37"/> that are in true Devotion, because that <hi>God will not be found except of those that seek him,</hi> nor gives those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Consolations but to such as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently desire them, and that pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, <hi>as pants the Hart after the living Brooks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us presuppose with these Consciences that flatter thus them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that these distractions and these Languors of Devotion are but sins of Infirmity, and consequently such as shall not be severely punish'd; yet what shall we say to their Number, and our every days relapses to them? Shall this to go for nothing? <hi>If thou despisest sins for being small, yet be afraid because they are great in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin:</hi> although they should appear light in the Balance of the Sanctuary, yet the Sum will undo us. For 'tis the work of every day. There is nothing smaller than grains of Sand, yet if you heap them up, they make a Hill: step by step we go to Hell, 'tis no great matter
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42872:38"/> then, what 'tis that leads us thither, whether one mighty sin, or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of little ones; one is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less damned. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> that had nought but Frogs or Flies upon them, were notwithstanding brought to the last extremity. Then let us not call those sins small, that without Gods gracious Pardon, will precipitate the Offenders down to Hell. But let us say with <hi>Anselm, It may be thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest some of thy sins, are small, Oh would to God, that our severe Judge would think them so too;</hi> but does not every sin dishonour God by disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? How is it then that we call those sins but small that offend so great a God; O dry and useless Tree, fit for eternal Flame, what canst thou answer at the great Day, when thou shalt give an account of every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Eye, when all thy lifetime shall be put in a Balance, and thou shalt be demanded how thou hast em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it every Minute? Then shall thy Process be made for every thing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42872:38"/> that did concern thee, not only for thy Words, but also for thy ill-tim'd Silence, and thy least Thoughts shall be examin'd; thy life it self shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come part of thy Crime, if 'twas not liv'd to God. O lamentable state! How many sins shall then proceed, from whence thou now seest none at all! they shall take thee unprovided and as it were in Ambuscade, and then they shall appear more terrible and more in number: the things thou thinkest now not evil, or that thou thinkest good perhaps, shall then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear both black and frightful. <hi>This difference,</hi> says S. <hi>Basil, of great and small sins is never found in all the new Testament, one Sentence is pronounc'd against them all; He that committeth sin, is the servant of sin;</hi> and if we give our selves the liberty of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing betwixt great and litle sins, it ought to be in this Sense, that that should be a great sin by which we are overcome, and that a little one we conquer, as amongst the Wrestlers,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42872:39"/> he that fell was always thought the weakest, and he that stood the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. Then happy is the Man that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses himself with this fear, and rids himself of that strong dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that Indevotion is so light and pardonable a Sin.</p>

                     <p>This is a mere Illusion, against which there is great need that I should fortifie my heart. Ah! what an Inclination have I to flatter and deceive my self in my sins, and to believe them little ones! Poor heart, thou art not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of thy disease, but thinkest thou art well, when thou art tending towards certain death; 'tis a most dangerous distemper that, to think that one is well when one is otherwise. Open thine Eyes, my heart, and see the danger thou art in continually. My sins do now appear but little ones, but they will one day appear great as they truly are. Defer no longer then to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the greatness, and to feel their burthen and their weight, to the end I may have them at present in abhorrence, and for the future may repent in dust and ashes: for otherwise I may repent too late, and acknowledge my evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42872:39"/> finding a Remedy. I drink up sins, as Fishes drink up water; I see nothing frightful in them, because I am accustom'd to the sight, and I think them little ones because I compare them still with greater ones: and above all I count my Indevotion and my Deadness nothing, because I persuade my self that God cannot be offended but by Impieties and Blasphemies.</p>

                     <p>This comes, my God, from hence, that I conceive not thee so great as thou indeed art; and I conceive not thee so great as thou art, because I see thee not. I tremble at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Man seated on a Tribunal with a Scepter in his hand, and a Crown upon his head, surrounded with a Royal Pomp. I am afraid of him because I see him; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that strike my Senses astonish my Soul. I know that thou art set amidst the Cherubims, and that the Angels hide their faces in thy sight, and cannot bear the lustre of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.

I am sensible of nothing but things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: my Eyes are more affected with the darkness of the Night, and with the glimmerings of a Glow-worm, than my imagination moved with the light of the absent Sun that's shining in another Hemisphere. Draw back then, O my God, draw back this Curtain from before my Eyes, and let me see thy Majesty; redouble thou the light of my souls Eyes: fill my imagination with the Idea's of thy Greatness and divine Glory, that I may once persuade my self that I am certainly in fault when I present my self before thee, with but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence or regard.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> That Impurity of Life is the first Source of Indevotion.</head>
                  <p>THIS Indevotion is a great Evil, let us try to find its Sources out, to the end we may cut this mischief off at the head. One of the chief is Impurity of Life; There is nothing disorders the heart so much as a habitude of Sin, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that quenches the fire of Piety, like the foul troubled waters of an unclean Life. Fire does not easily take hold of wet Wood; Devotion does not easily fasten on vicious Souls. Devotion and Sin are incompatible for several reasons: One flame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishes another, and the fire of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42872:41"/> Lusts stifles the fire of Zeal, as the flame of Powder puts out the light of a Candle. Devotion is a certain sprightliness of Mind that disposes us to approach to God with Confidence and Trust; but how should we obtain this disposition whilst we continue in sin? And is not this to offer up to God such Sacrifices as we know he has in abomination? for God, we know, will have no sullied and polluted Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; <hi>Go get ye gone,</hi> says he, <hi>I hate your solemn Feasts; as for your Offerings of Rams, and the fat of fed Beasts I take them as I do the price of Whoredom, as Swines blood, and a Dogs neck.</hi> Alas! the purest man is not yet pure enough to present himself before his God with good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and the Prophets themselves may say, <hi>What shall I do, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I am a man of unclean lips, mine eyes have seen the King the Lord of hosts.</hi> It cannot be, but that he who has not on the Marriage Garment, but is sullied with the Impurities of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42872:41"/> flesh, should not be terribly afraid of him, before whom the Stars are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the Angels are not clean; and how then shall this Fear, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Horror be consistent with Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is all Love, and all Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? <hi>Let us go,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul, with boldness to the Throne of grace to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy in the time of need.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to God a Conscience full of sin, is to carry our Witness along with us, and make our own Process, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver our selves into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. We need not therefore won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a wicked man is indevout, and that he flies Gods presence. But though Impurity of life should do no other thing but take away all hope of having our Prayers heard, 'twould be enough to hinder our Devotion; all other Vertues are concern'd in this, and he that takes away their Hopes, takes away their Life also. How can a wicked man then pray devoutly, that knows God will not hear him? <hi>When ye stretch out your hands, and multiply
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42872:42"/> your prayers, I will not answer you,</hi> saith God, <hi>because your hands are full of blood.</hi> Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have us <hi>lift up clean hands without wrath, and without contention.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>If there had been iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in me, the Lord had not heard me.</hi> Therefore in another place he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests, <hi>he will wash his hands in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and so will he go to his Altar.</hi> And why should God have respect to their Prayers, who have none to his Commands? Upon these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the wicked may well say, To what purpose should I present my self before God? My sins have shut the gates of Heaven upon me, and why should I ask any thing of him, that is resolv'd already to deny me? These would be but insignificant Devotions and Submissions, that, it may be, might but hasten Judgments on me. I could not have the face to ask for any thing, unless God first had promis'd it, but I resolve to hold to nothing, but to continue in the way I am in. Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42872:42"/> is of great Extent, it takes up all the heart, it cannot stay in any Soul divided betwixt it and Ambition, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, Violence, love of the World and Pleasures. If then you see some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Worldling that refuses nothing to his heart, have his set days of regular Devotion, nay, and sometimes break into Floods of Tears and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sorrows; conclude undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that those are Hypocrites, that would pay God with Looks, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose on men with fair Appearances. There are, it may be, some that are the cheats of their own hearts, and think they are very good men, when they expiate for the debauches of a Month, by one days fasting. But they are greatly out, for true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not thus unequal, nor full of Sallies and Irregularities. It is not like the floods in Spring that flow with fury, but continue but a day; Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of life is therefore of absolute necessity to the attaining true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a necessary Preliminary.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42872:43"/> This Vertue is one of those most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces we receive from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and one of the most precious gifts of the holy Ghost; but 'tis a Pearl that is not cast before Swine, 'tis an Enamel only fit for Gold; a Favour only communicated to privileg'd, that is to say, to pure and clean Souls. But because we shall meet with this Subject again, we will not exhaust it here.</p>

Who can cast up the miseries, in which the naughtiness of my heart hath engag'd me? and amongst the rest is this, that it renders me incapable of Devotion. 'Tis sin hath made a separation betwixt God and me, and therefore I am dead, for God is my life, and my souls Soul; I am blind and strayed from God that is my light: I am poor, being separated from him, for he was my Treasure and Abundance. I am naked, for he alone it was that cloathed me: I am sick, for it was he, my Sun of Righteousness that carries healing in his wings,

'Tis sin hath rob'd me of him, and eclips'd him from my sight, and I must languish out my life, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from him that was and is my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And in this state, Oh how can I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce those vigorous movements of Devotion, that raise the Soul and carry it up as far as Paradise?

                  <p>ONE of the greatest reasons why there are so few truly devout ones in the World, is, that the World is too too much belov'd; and this Worlds Love is one of the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Temptations that the Devil uses, to distract and turn our hearts aside. This Love hath pierc'd into our very inwards, and whilst it governs in our Hearts, how should the love of God come there? for light and darkness, fire and water, life and death, are not more incompatible than those two sorts of Love. <hi>He that loveth the world, the love of the Father dwelleth not in him.</hi> And where there is no love of God, how shall there be Devotion? for what is it but this same Love that makes the zeal and fire of true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion?
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42872:45"/> What is it but this Love that creates those ardent longings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Union with God in the devout Souls? What is it else that gives such pleasure in possession of him? 'Tis this that gives good Souls that readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and chearfulness in serving God. 'Tis this that maketh all things easie to the Soul that loves. Now then as much as the Love of God forwards Devotion, so much the Love of this World hinders it; it quenches the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout. Ardors, stifles good Desires, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranges us from God, takes away all Relish of things spiritual, and steals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart, and carries it away we know not whether. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was going towards the Hills, but still she had her heart in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and thither turns her Eyes. The superiour part of the Soul, that loves the things of Heaven, makes some Efforts to raise it self to God; but the inferiour part, where all the Passions reign, turns the Eyes towards the World, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the heart from the divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42872:45"/> which it began to enter on with God. When <hi>Rachel</hi> left her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, she took away with her his <hi>Teraphims:</hi> so when we leave the World and enter into our Closets, we carry with us all its Idols and vain Images, and those unhappy Thoughts that will be crossing our Devotion. These are the Idols of Gold and Silver, the Devils Avarice and Ambition, that pass and repass a hundred times in a quarter of an hour to distract our minds, and spoil us of attention. Our Brains, when we come to Prayer, are fill'd with a thousand Ideas of good and evil things, desires and fears, of dangers and distrusts, hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, sports and divertisements, with other vain Objects. And can a Soul already thus possess'd give place to any Images of God's Greatness, his Majesty, Goodness, Mercy and Love? Can Faith, Repentance, Charity, Zeal, Hope, Gratitude, and other Vertues that make up, or are any ways helpful to Devotion, can they, I say, consist
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42872:46"/> with the movements that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of this World inspires us with▪ We can hardly think of any thing but what our hearts are taken withal: if we lov'd the World less, it would not so often return upon our minds: We are charm'd therewith, it is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that we cannot find a place of refuge against its persecutions; the solitude and dismal Objects of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart cannot banish it. An Antient tells us that amidst his macerating Mortifications, his Imagination brought him in the Wilderness, a Troop of beauteous Maids, in Jollity and Dance. We must therefore employ all our strength and abilities to drain this fruitful Source, if we would be truly devout. <hi>My little Children, love not the World, nor the things of the World.</hi> We must crucifie the old Man, if we would present our selves to God a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sacrifice, holy, and acceptable, which is our reasonable Service. Thus one of the most useful Meditations, by which we may prepare our selves for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42872:46"/> Prayer, is this, of the Vanity of the World. 'Tis good to enter into ones self, to consider the shortness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, the inconstant glory of the World that flourishes in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and at the Evening fades away. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42872:47"/> with the putrid Air of this World, we shall chase away these worldly thoughts, it may be drive those filthy Birds away that come to spoil our Sacrifice, and to devour that good seed of Piety, which the heavenly Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman hath sown there.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of too great Sensibility of earthly Pleasures, the third Source of Indevotion.</head>
                  <p>THE love of the World is as a great Tree spreading into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Branches, which are as so many Sources of Indevotion. The first branch of this Love, is, a too great sensibility of earthly Pleasures. These Pleasures are of two sorts: the first are highly Criminal, and are those we call the Debauches of the Gallants of the World; and of these it is certain, that not only an excessive sensibility, but even the least tast, is a mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Devotion. Spiritual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are of so different a Relish from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42872:49"/> those of the Flesh, that one cannot at the same time love the one and t'other. A palate used to gall and wormwood, and that tasts no other thing, can never bear the sweets of Sugar and Honey. A man that's plung'd into the pleasures of Sin, can have no gust or relish for the Joys of Heaven. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Pleasures, whose Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the World maintains, because the fault is not so visible: but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as they either are, or may be, they quickly become criminal by their Excess. The continuation of Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (the most innocent) becomes an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, and may become great hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Piety, as little sensible as we are of the mischief. The holy Spirit is call'd the <hi>Comforter,</hi> and the relish that the faithful find in exercises of Devotion, are call'd <hi>divine Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> But to what and whom are Comforters and Comforts given, but to the afflicted? In truth, those Souls that are so full of the joys of this World, are not very fit to receive the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42872:49"/> spiritual Consolations, and salutary impressions of the divine Comforter. 'Tis therefore Jesus Christ says, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</hi> And S. <hi>Augustin</hi> said to God, <hi>Thou art the only true, the only Sovereign pleasure, that art capable of filling a Soul; remove far from me these false pleasures, and at the same time enter thou thy self into their place; thou who art sweeter, and more dear than all the pleasures in the World, but not to flesh and blood.</hi> The Manna fell not on the <hi>Israelites,</hi> but when the Provisions fail'd, they brought with them from <hi>Egypt.</hi> Surely this Manna of divine Grace, these Ravishments and Joys of Devotion, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to those who are stor'd with Magazines of goods from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and the pleasures of the World.</p>
                  <p>A person that returns from a Ball or Comedy, must needs be very ill dispos'd for Devotion; 'twill be to little purpose to say in favour of the Theatre, that it is now become chast,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42872:50"/> and that we meet with nothing there, but Lessons of Vertue. They may say, if they will, that Passions are only display'd there, as animated in defence of Honour, and produce no other Sentiments but those of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity. For my own part, I say, the Vertues of the Theatre are Crimes according to the spirit of the Gospel; and though we may hear something that's good from thence, yet it is well nigh spoil'd by the polluted lips and imaginations through which it passes. <hi>O impious wickedness,</hi> said <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, thou hast brought Heaven upon the Stage, and God himself is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Comedy.</hi> O impious wickedness, may I say too, in imitation of him, thou hast brought Vertue on the Stage and made it look like a <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi> Jesus Christ would not have his Preachers appear in Trunk-hose, with Paint and Patches on their Faces. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> said S. <hi>Cyprian, revives the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient sins in its Verses, lest they should die with Age;</hi> we draw them from
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42872:50"/> their Sepulchres of a thousand or twelve hundred years standing. We teach the present Age, the sins they might, perhaps, have never thought on; they think that what was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done, may be done as well at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: and thus we make examples of those Actions that had ceased from being Crimes and doing Mischief. And yet this is Tragedy whose Innocence may be defended best, and with the greatest Colour. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> who were very wise, banish'd these criminal Amusements from amongst them, because say they, it was not fit to violate the Laws even in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but respect them even upon the Stage. And this puts me in mind of what <hi>Cicero</hi> said upon a time; <hi>that it was not honest or fit, for Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or Rhetoricians to exercise their faculties, though but in jest, against the existence or the providence of God. We owe them this respect, not to divert our selves at their Expence.</hi> And I say the same of Vertue: It is not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42872:51"/> to be pleased, with seeing it, or play'd upon, or outrag'd on the Theatre. But besides, these Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles are absolutely inconsistent with Devotion, because they fill the Soul with vain Passions, and we have need to have our Souls at liberty. They create real Joys and Sadnesses for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Adventures: they fill the mind with Images, and the heart with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Vanity that quite destroy those holy Dispositions, that we would establish in a devout Soul.</p>
                  <p>It is the same with Play; 'tis a Madness that possesses men like a kind of Devil. A man sees roll, as one may say, his life and death, his good and evil fortune in a little Box: he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the throw with Inquietudes and inconceivable Transports; his Soul is agitated at the same with a thousand different Passions, of Fears, Desires, and Hopes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and his Heart is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of its proper Station. Is such a man in fit condition to raise his Soul towards God? They would be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42872:51"/> fine Devotions, these that are made after having sat up almost all Night, at Gaming. The Tempest hath been too long, and the Floods will roll a great deal longer: the Soul will be a great while before she recovers her breath again; and after all, the sweets of Devotion will not relish to his tast, because they are not those Pleasures of which alone she is sensible. And hence it comes that young Folks are so seldom fit for Flights and Elevations of Devotion. They enter presently upon the World, and every thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears beautiful, and carries with it the Charms of Novelty. They take long draughts of sensual Pleasures, and nothing is agreeable but that which flatters Flesh and Blood that boils within their Veins. And hence it is moreover, that that Temperament of Blood, where the Sanguine prevails, which is the temperament of Joy and Pleasure, is less proper for Devotion, than that which takes in somewhat of the Earth and Melancholy. The
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42872:52"/> first is like matter extremely combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, that takes fire at the first spark; but the second is more difficult to stir, and is less sensible to that which charms the others, and that which enters deep into the one, scarcely raises the Skin of t'other. We must therefore draw men from this Mistake. They fansie they can partake, and as it were divide themselves between two sorts of Pleasure, those of Heaven and those of Earth; but 'tis not to be done. The Law puts in the number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beasts, all such as swim and fly, and live amphibious in two Elements of Earth and Water. 'Tis the Emblem of Worldlings. They swim continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Pleasures of the Flesh, and sometimes with feeble Efforts try to withdraw, and raise themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven; but it happens to them, as it does to those Fishes whose Flight is no higher, than just to skim the Superficies of the Streams with their Wings, and presently fall again into their usual Element. <hi>Rare and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42872:52"/> delicious,</hi> says S. <hi>Bernard, is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Consolation; it is a chast but jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Lady, that deserving to be only lov'd, will not bestow her self on him that runneth after Strangers.</hi> 'Tis for this reason <hi>Solomon</hi> cries out <hi>Vanity</hi> on all the Pleasures of the World, of which he had, to his cost, made a most sad Experiment; and for this reason <hi>David</hi> does so oft declare, that he desires no other Joys than those of possessing God. <hi>Leave all,</hi> said Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>thou shalt find all; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is to be found in God by him that for the sake of God despises every thing.</hi> This is therefore one of the best Advices one can give to those good Souls that would dispose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a devout Life. Renounce then, oh thou Soul that wouldst be good, renounce the Pleasures of this World, and chuse the spiritual ones: Let reading of good things delight thee more than the most sensual Joys do the most worldly-minded. Let the holy Assemblies, and the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42872:53"/> of the Word divert thee, as the rest are diverted at their criminal Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles: Let works of Mercy towards the poor and needy be as sweet to thee, as their vain Courses, Sports, and idle Conversations are to them: and if thou dost at any time relax, let Honesty and rigid Vertue be the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters and the Measures of thy Pleasures.</p>

Thou hast not yet tasted the pleasures of devout and pious Souls, that say, <hi>I am satisfied as it were with Marrow and fatness: I have tasted of the goodness of the Lord; his Love is pleasanter than Wine, and sweeter than the Hony comb; let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.</hi> Oh would to God I had been honor'd with those secret Commerces, with which my

                  <p>ANother Branch of the Love of the World, and a new Obstacle to Devotion, is, the Cares and Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the World. Black and dismal Spirits, that frequently withdraw us from the company of our Saviour. Christ, to lead us amongst the Tombs, and walk us in the ruins of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and our Greatness. There are in the World more miserable than happy People, so that this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42872:55"/> is at least as common as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going one. We love this World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and therefore when we lose it, heartily bewail our Loss. A man whom contrary Winds have driven from his desired Haven, can't chuse but turn his Eyes that way, and loses not the sight of it without an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable deal of Trouble. If he would lay himself to rest, the Image of his Country, Wife and Children, and his Friends, return incessantly upon his mind, and continue on his Grief and Pain. So an afflicted Soul that would retire into it self, and unite with God, sees in the midst of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions the Images of his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, that awake his Griefs, and draw him down from Heaven, to plunge him in the bottomless Abyss. These are the Wasps and Gnats, whose Stings are sharp and piercing. While we are fixt to any good Work, and give our whole attention to it, then come these Insects, and pierce so to the quick, that a man cannot forbear to put out
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42872:55"/> his hand. These are the Rods with which the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-masters make us make hast to the Works of the Flesh, that Brick-making. These Task-masters are the Spirits that say as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said, This people is lazy, and since they will needs serve God, double their Labours on them: and then they rouse those sharp and piercing Cares, awakening in one Man the memory of a Suit at Law he lost, and in anothers mind the sad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of his Affairs, and the downfal of his Family: in another the threatning of Disgrace, or death of some beloved person. And then these Thoughts, like so many sharp points, hasten the man to return to his gathering Straw, his worldly Occupations, that quite take off his mind from God. If then we would repose our selves in Gods bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, we must drive away these buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Creatures from our Ears, and lay these cursed busie Spirits. And as the Spouse says, <hi>Ye Daughters of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>I charge you by the Hinds and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42872:56"/> Roes, that ye stir not, nor awake my Love until he please.</hi> So we must say, Be gone vain carnal Thoughts, Cares of this World, ye piercing Cares; be gone ye cursed Spirits, return to your Abyss, and leave my Soul at rest, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb and trouble not my holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations; withdraw me not from my beloved's Arms, in whose sweet Company is all my Joy and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>There are good Remedies against this Temptation, if we will but make use of them: The first is, to rid ones self of the Love of this World: if we love it no more, we should be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible no more of the Misfortunes that happen to us from it. Let us leave loving Mony, and see whether Riches, Honours, or the loss of them can touch us. Let us but set our Hearts on God, and we shall always be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for we can never lose him. The World makes us pay Interest for its Pleasures; the Grief it causes, when it leaves us, is greater far than the pleasure
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42872:56"/> we found in its possession; and therefore we must leave it in good time, that we may lose it quite without much trouble. If we have any reasonable and lawful Concerns, and which we cannot rid our selves of, let us follow <hi>David</hi>'s Counsel, <hi>Commit thy care unto the Lord, and he shall bring it to pass.</hi> We want not Examples to support this confidence and trust: we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an <hi>Elias</hi> in the Wilderness, whom the Ravens fed; a Prophet in the Lions Den, whom those wild Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had respect to: the <hi>Israelites</hi> in barren and uninhabited Countries, on whom the Heavens rain'd down Bread. Have we need of Assurance; See then the Promise of our Lord; <hi>The Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows fall not to the ground without your heavenly Father; the very hairs of your head are numbred, ye are of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than many Sparrows; the fowls of the air have neither barns nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.</hi> Will God that hears the Ravens crying, forsake you? Sure
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42872:57"/> we must have a mighty share of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, to distrust so great and many Promises. And after all this, let us remember that our concern and cares, change nothing in the state of our Affairs; but only overturn our Souls as it were, and make them incapable of Devotion. Therefore our Lord would have us take no care, even for to morrow, for fear it should disturb the Devotion of this present Day. When therefore we enter into our Closet, we must say to our selves, why dost thou trouble thy self about so many things, when it may be thou shalt die to morrow? Thou art afraid to want Necessaries, but little thinkest that these Necessaries are but very few. Thou hast had some Losses already, and art afraid of more; but this is it, that God is retrenching thy Superfluities. After all this, how canst thou fear to want, when thou art just a going to find thy God, to whom all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long? Say with S. <hi>Austin, Throw thy self, my Soul, into the arms of God, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42872:57"/> do not fear that he will suffer thee to fall, for his Arm supports both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</hi> And when thou hast thus said, shut fast thy Door, and put these Cares and Troubles under thy feet, and fall upon thy knees.</p>

My Eyes are dry and unrelenting as a Rock. <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod must strike me, and the terrour of Gods judgments must seize me, ere I can break forth into floods. But yet I want not tears to grieve for my Disgraces, and what the world calls Misfortunes. I am not at all sparing of Tears, but I bestow them ill. Why art thou so troubled, O my Soul, at the loss of those things of which thou art but to have the use, and from which Death will undoubtedly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thee away? Dost thou not know the world and Fortune are of Glass? they shine, but they are very brittle, a little blow breaks them,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42872:58"/> and makes them fly to pieces: VVhy shouldst thou find it strange then, if this Glass should break between thy hands? VVhy art thou then so sensible of injuries and wrongs? And why dost thou make anothers malice and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity thy misfortune? VVhy dost thou then bewail so bitterly the loss of those whom Death deprives thee of? They were not thine, but Gods, who lent them thee, and takes them now again? And why art thou so prodigal of tears, from which thou canst reap so little fruit? This is to employ ones labour for that which nourisheth not. VVhen thou bewailest thy Misfortunes, thy tears do not make those misfortunes end: but bewail thy sins, and they will be thereby destroy'd; they will make a stream, that will carry them away, and they shall be no mere. Thy carnal cares and perplexities trouble thy Devotion, but the grief thou shalt shew for thy sins and infirmities, will encrease thy Piety, and God shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee.</p>

                     <p>Descend then, O thou Spirit of Consolation, that hast been promis'd from the Father, by the Son. Come sweeten thou my bitterness of Soul;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42872:58"/> Come recompence me for my losses by thy Riches: Come render me those joys that pass all Vnderstanding: Come give me Piety, that I may have content of mind, that one and the other join'd together may be to me great gain, and make my sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign happiness: Come, set my Soul in so firm a station, that it cannot be shaken by the rudest Shocks: Come give me all that I have lost, my goods, possessions, houses, husband, wife, my children, father, mother, kinsfolks and dear friends: Give me my self, and thou wilt give me all thou tookest from me. Come, O my Saviour, let me perfectly possess thee that thou mayst be to me instead of every thing besides. The World hath taken from me all it gave, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rob me of thy Presence.

So that I may be in thy Presence, as in a peaceable and quiet Haven, freed from the storms and tempests, that disturb and drive me up and down: and that the commerce of my Soul with thee, may not be broken off by the remembrance of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Exceeding Multiplicity of Affairs, a fifth Source of Indevotion.</head>
                  <p>THIS is another Branch of the Love of the World, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindrance of Devotion. We love the World and give our selves entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to its Affairs. One is employed in Merchandise, and thinks of nothing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42872:59"/> else: another's busied in anothers Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and makes it his own for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest: he pleads as is said, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Justice, but it is often in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Sin, and whilst he gains his Cause, loses his Conscience. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician visits his Patients, with design to make them pay dear for his Service. A man of business is always casting up his Accounts. The Artisan exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises his Art; the labouring Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his Tillage. And thus the better part of all mens time is spent, and the World is so corrupt, that we think these men deserve commendation for their Diligence, because it is one of the most innocent ways of losing time; but for all that, 'tis criminal when it steals our Hearts from God and relaxes our Devotion. The mind of Man is so contriv'd and made that it cannot vigorously tend to more things than one, or earnestly desire them. So that if a man bends the Ardor of his Desires, and the strength of his inclinations towards his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42872:60"/> and Trade, God, for his share, will have but the relicks of the Soul, and faint and languishing Desires.</p>
                  <p>I pretend not that persons of all Conditions should give up themselves entirely to Contemplation. That kind of life is proper only to the Angels, and not to Men. And since one half of us is Body, we must think to live a life that is partly bodily. A Bird, be it never so strong, yet cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be upon the Wing: nor has a Soul sufficient force to be continually soaring towards Heaven. I know moreover, we must serve the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of Nature; In a word, I oppose not my self to that decree, that Man receiv'd from God, to eat his Bread in the sweat of his Brows, and labour six days in a Week. I only would desire, that <hi>Martha</hi>'s business might not hinder <hi>Mary</hi>'s, nor that the Body which is our least part should carry away the best and greatest portion of our time. If we have any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to praise Gods gracious condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42872:60"/> to us, 'tis on this Occasion. All our time is his, but he gives us six parts in seven: <hi>Six days shalt thou labour, but the seventh day is the Sabbath.</hi> And since he is so bountiful, we ought to be exact, in paying back to him this Tithe of Time, one day in seven, and one hour in seven; six hours should not pass without returning to our God, to offer him the Seventh. If you do more, you will not do too much, since 'tis to him we owe it all.</p>
                  <p>Why should you not observe the same Measures, in respect to the Soul, as ye do to the Body? You give that Rest and its Repasts, and break off the most important Affairs you have, to repair its lost spirits and strength. Take heed the spirits of Grace be not too far spent. Recal the Soul to its Exercises of Devotion, as to Repasts, to make it strong and vigorous: and as to Sleep, during which it is gently laid in Gods Arms, and fill'd with blest Ideas, and with pleasing Visions.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42872:61"/> We must, I say, oft labour for this heavenly Recollection and withdraw the Soul, from the wandring courses it is taking over Human things.</p>
                  <p>The running hasty Banquets are attended with Indigestions, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish little or none at all; and therefore we sit down and rest at Meals: And can a man then think to serve God whilst he is doing somewhat else? These turbulent Devotions are the evil Banquets that oppress and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Soul, rather than give it any nourishment or strength. We must therefore take off our selves in due time from our ordinary Affairs, that our Souls may retire into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as to a Port, there to enjoy a Calm after a Storm. Whilst the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in motion, it can neither well receive nor reflect the Image of the Sun. So a Soul in continual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot well receive the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Grace, the Rays of Jesus Christ who is the Sun of Righteousness; nor the Image of the great God. Thou
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42872:61"/> troubled Sea, impetuous Soul, keep thy self still, stop thy Waters, that they may be Heavens Mirrour, that all its Lights may penetrate, and be drawn out on thee. <hi>How can the knowledge of God,</hi> saith S. <hi>Basil, enter into a Soul that is already taken up with a croud of carnal thoughts?</hi> One must be master of himself and time, to give ones self to God. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> well understood this thing, when he said to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that which you say, <hi>Come let us go and serve our God,</hi> proceeds from hence, that you have nothing else to do.</p>
                  <p>God, I avow, loves not the sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: and how should he love an idle Life, when he will punish every idle Word? But neither does he love those that are too much busied. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art cumbred about many things, but</hi> Mary <hi>hath chosen the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part:</hi> She was not busied about <hi>evil</hi> things, but about <hi>too many:</hi> She did a good work even in what she then did: She serv'd our Saviour, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42872:62"/> prepar'd him Meat and Drink. If there could be excess in those innocent and charitable Occupations, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men from coming oftner to their Lord, what shall we think of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of this World at large? How many persons must there be excluded from the sacred Festival of our Lord, and from his marriage Feast, and of what sort? They shall be those that are busied; the one in buying and proving a Yoke of Oxen, the other in purchasing and visiting his House, and a third in marrying of a Wife. These men shall find the Door shut; they found not time to come, when it was seasonable, and when they find their own time, there shall no time be found to open the Gate unto them. They shall hear these words as well as all the rest, <hi>Be gone ye workers of nothing, I know you not.</hi> Let us not then say, To day I must go to such a place, to morrow I must do this and t'other thing, and after I will think on God. Ah my Soul, thy great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42872:62"/> is to set thy self aright with God, and often to consult how he is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards thee, to sollicit his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and implore the succors of his Grace; to pay thy just Homage, and bring him into thy Interests. This is the one, the necessary thing; Chuse then this good part, that shall not be taken from thee. <hi>This one thing I do, forgetting those things that are behind,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.3.</note>
                     <hi>and reaching forth to those things which are before, I press towards the mark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let not the indevout ones then object the multiplicity of Business. They that are most busied, can steal time, to give to their <hi>pleasures,</hi> and therefore may take as much at least, to do their <hi>duty</hi> in. Let them not object the goodness and the innocence of these Employs; that cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be innocent, that keeps us back from God, and makes us blameable before him.</p>
                  <p>But what shall we say of those that make a business of adjusting, or dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42872:63"/> the Head exactly, and setting all things in great Order; that consult their Glass an hundred times, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be misplac'd, and spend the best part of their lives in these vain idle Businesses, and that of all their hours can hardly spare a few to give to their Devotion? I say, they have a sad account to give of all: of the time they have so miserably thrown away: of the beauty of which they made so bad use: of the unjust divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made between God and their Idol; since they have employed all their lives in serving that, and given to God but some few moments, of a precipitate and slurr'd Devotion.</p>

                     <p>Poor Soul, how unhappy art thou, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to serve perpetually, a body that renders nought but evil to thee, for all the good thou dost to it! Thou labourest after abundance of things, and runnest from one end of the World to the other; Thou venturest all the tempests of the Sea, and exposest thy self to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42872:63"/> its fury: thy body is burnt by the scorchings of the Sun; Thou passest from the Icy Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to the Torrid Zone: Thou rowest on the jaws of the Deep whole years together, to seek for Riches, Gold and Silver, Pearls, and other fine things. If not this, thou dost some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else as good, and takest as much pains to as little purpose, and all for a body that is but dust, and must to dust return again. 'Tis true, it is a burthen God hath laid upon thee, to take care of thy body, but thou dost infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increase that weight. The Body would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it self with little; if thou wouldst serve it, as it should be served: and consequently it would take thee but a little time, whereas thou givest it all. What blindness and what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is it? VVhat will be the return of all these pains? The Body for which thou takest them all, will not preserve the Riches thou hast gathered up, no, nor no more of them, than one poor Winding-sheet, a Coffin, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout six foot of ground. O my Soul 'tis on thy self thou shouldst bestow thy thoughts and pains. Thou art a Queen, and art become a Slave; Thou shouldst be serv'd, and thou thy self dost vilely serve another. Thou neglectest to heap up true Riches, and therefore thou art poor and blind and naked. I advise thee therefore to purchase Gold, and Food and Raiment of him, who says, <hi>Ho, all that thirst, come to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42872:64"/> waters, come and buy wine and milk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money.</hi>

Make me to know what are the true goods that I may give them all my love, and all my care; and may no longer make my application to the business of this World my greatest Vertue. That I may use my Body as a Slave that is inclined to rebel, but may serve thee, as a Lord, whose inclinations are perpetually favourable to me; that I may seek first thy Kingdom and its righteousness, that all the rest may be added thereto. Let not my Soul be unthankful or distrustful, or ever come to doubt his goodness who hath given so many tokens of his love and tenderness. How can it fear that thou shouldst let it want
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42872:64"/> any thing, who furnishest the Ravens when they cry, and the young Lions take their rest and lay them down within their Dens. Alas, it labors for the things of this life, as though 'twould last for ever, and neglects the t'other life, as though 'twould never come. <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi> Make me to understand the truth and excellence of everlasting Life, to the end I may neglect the present one; that I may make such Friends, as may receive me into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Habitations, and may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire such Riches as I may carry hence along with me, and may make choice of that good part, that shall not be taken from me.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The sixth Source of Indevotion, the Custom of letting the mind stray on different Objects.</head>
                  <p>I Think this is another Source of Indevotion, and especially of our Distractions. We cannot fix our hearts whilst we are at Prayer, and our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is lost: from whence comes this? 'Tis from an evil Custom we have got, of giving liberty to our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations; 'tis that in men, which Quicksilver is in other Metals. It rolls, and flows, and a little fire makes it evaporate and vanish away, as it were, in Smoak, it becomes at last so subtle. We permit it to do what it will, and it flies from East to West, from North to South, and from Heaven to Earth, and as tho the bounds of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse were too little for it; it flies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, and loses it self in imaginary
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42872:65"/> Spaces. It cannot shut it self within the bounds of time, but passes on to Eternity, enquiring what is done there, and what was doing, whilst there was nothing done. If it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it self within the Universe in this wide Space, it flutters over every thing, and glides upon their Surfaces, but dives into nothing to the bottom. And as if the Creatures that are in being were not enow to take it up, it fancies new ones, and imagines Fantomes and Chimera's: It makes Mountains of Gold, Worlds in the Moon, Centaures, and Hippogryphs: and those movements are commonly so quick, that in less than a quarter of an hour of this Visionary wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, we are gone so far, that the ablest man in the World, though he know our last Thought, shall never be able to divine what was our first. And after this, shall we ask whence come these wandrings of our thoughts in the exercises of Devotion? How can we think a Soul accustomed to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42872:66"/> wander thus, should fix and stop all all on the sudden? 'Tis a Horse that never yet receiv'd the Bit, and hath done nothing hitherto but run, and leap about in the Meadows, day and night, when you would put the Saddle on his back, and the Bridle in his mouth, he breaks away and throws his Rider, and returns from whence he came. When we would recollect our Soul, it scatters like a flame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; it leaves us quite, and breaks the Bridle or restraint of Piety, and before we perceive its first escapes, we find our selves plung'd deep, in the diversity of vain Thoughts. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> well discovered, what was the cause of our Distractions. <hi>Then,</hi> saith he, <hi>when our mind is fill'd with Fantomes, and carries with it an infinite company of vain Thoughts, it comes to pass that our Prayes are troubled and interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that being in thy Presence, O God, we try to make thee hear the voice of our Heart, and although it be an action of such importance, yet 'tis travers'd and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42872:66"/> crost by some vain Image that comes I know not whence, to cast it self into my mind, and to disturb it with the rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we have well understood the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Evil, we shall easily conceive the Remedy. Evils must be cur'd by their contraries. Let us learn to set bounds to our Imaginations; let us not suffer them to roam so far, that we may bring them back with the less difficulty: that is to dispose our Hearts to Devotion; we must accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom our minds to meditate on few, but good things. 'Tis a Mercury that must fix by applying to it Gold and Silver; a lively faculty, to which we must apply both Reins and Bridle. But let us not think the secret of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this distemper of the Soul, is to retain our mind in the privation of all Thoughts: this is not possible to Nature, nor profitable to Grace. The imagination of Man is too active; it is impossible to hold it doing nothing; 'tis to kill it, this to keep it without Employ; for action is its very life:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42872:67"/> God hath not given us Faculties so noble, to bury them in shameful idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And after all, if the Mind were habituated to think on nothing, we should at least have as much trouble to fasten it on the works of Piety, as now we have to reclaim it from its Wandrings and Vagaries.</p>
                  <p>From all this I conclude, that the Occupations of the wise and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing men of the World are, it may be, more destructive of Devotion than any in the World besides. The Eye is never weary of seeing, nor the Ear of hearing; and we are so far from reckoning these for Faults, that they pass for great Vertues.</p>
                  <p>Under protection of the glorious names of Sciences, good Learning, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Searches, sublime Speculations, Experiments, and wondrous Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we establish and set up in the World a Method of dividing the Soul with a distraction almost remediless, And would to God, experience did not give us abundance of proofs of this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42872:67"/> Truth. 'Tis certain and well known the Atheists are not of the Ignorant, or Vulgar. The <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s, <hi>Drotago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>'s and <hi>Diagoras</hi>'s, have still been learned Men, and great Wits; the thing is passed into a Proverb. They say, that those who because of their Profession, are obliged to study Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very much and second Causes, apply themselves so strongly to them, that they quite forget to ascend to the first. These Gentlemen so knowing in Antiquity, and that make such a figure in the Empire of Learning for their understanding, make no great shew of Devotion in the Church. 'Tis the study of holy things that only can inspire a habit of Devotion. We see but too too often great Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue bad Christians, because they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not their labours to the glory of God. They take pains only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and aim alone at their own glory. I would never then advise the man that would be truly devout, to take upon him many things, nor bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42872:68"/> his mind with Conjectures, and his memory with <hi>May-be</hi>'s, of which that which they call <hi>good Learning</hi> is wholly made up. Besides, that this false Science begets a habitude of Pride, the Enemy of Devotion; it inspires moreover a Spirit of <hi>Pyrrhomsme</hi> and doubt, that from Philosophy passes to Divinity. Because they find little or nothing certain in humane Sciences: they take the same liberty to doubt of divine Revelations: they accustom themselves to judge according to the light of Reason, condemning every thing that does not agree thereto; and are rash enough to introduce into the Church that Principle they should have left behind them in the Schools.</p>
                  <p>I design not hereby to be an Advocate for Ignorance, since we are all Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of this World, it is permitted us to enquire into what is done there. But the Author of Nature, whose side we take, hath shewn us with what reserve we ought to set our selves to the discovery of his Secrets. He hath
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42872:68"/> let us see but the Effects, and hath hidden almost all the Causes. Which teaches us that we may easily be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowledge since hidden things are not for us. I don't know if a little Ignorance would not serve better to the glory of our Creator. If we understood but Nature as well as we would understand it, it might be, we should less admire its Author, for Wonder is, as is said in these Cases, the Daughter of Ignorance. And it is certain, we are wont to admire things excellent the less, the more we see them; and the more we think we understand them.</p>
                  <p>The desire of Knowledge deceives us, but let us take good heed of its Surprizes; the desire of knowing Good and Evil as Gods cost our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents too too dear. Whilst they were good, they knew not they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they got that knowledge and a great deal of the like by the loss of their Innocence: their know of God alone should be the Subject of all our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42872:69"/> labours, and that's enough to take up our whole life. <hi>Blessed is he that knoweth thee, and nothing else but thee,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austine, and wretched is the man that knoweth all things in the World, without thee; but he that knows both thee and all things else is happy, not because he knows those other things, but that among the rest he knoweth thee!</hi> O run not then, my Soul, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these empty Shadows of Science, or if thou runnest, run as after Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows not with so much love and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Apply thy self only to Contemplate upon God; 'tis an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Object, and infinitely greater than all the Creatures put together: and yet this vast Object will not cause that dissipation and distraction that is inseparable from the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creatures. He is an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, but such a one as recollects himself in one Point: a Sun that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites his Rays in the bottom of thy Heart, to fill it both with light and Flame. <hi>Let the devout Soul,</hi> saith S.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42872:69"/>
                     <hi>Basil, be as Mirroir and clear Chrystal Glass, that receives no Image but that of her divine Spouse. Let her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wholly fill'd with this Image, to the end that any forein things coming there, may find no place to set or shew themselves to our Imaginations.

It will not fly out so easily: and as now when it flies from us, it lights into its wonted paths, and falls
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42872:70"/> upon its familiar Idea's; so when once these different thoughts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come strange to it, by its rare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them, the Mind will not so easily be carried to them.</p>

I know thee, O my God, because thou hast been pleased to shew thy self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, but that which I know, alas what is it in respect of what thou art, and of what might be known? I see thee darkly, and I form to my self an Idea of thy Essence and thy Majesty, that brings thee infinitely below thy self. I do thee wrong, my God, but otherwise I cannot do. I beg thy pardon; I do not conceive of thee as I ought to do, and 'tis the fault of my Mind as well as of my Heart. Cleanse thou mine Eyes, that I may look on thee as vigorously and fiercely as the Eagle looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42872:71"/> the Sun. Let the knowledge of thy Beauty charm my Heart and fill me so, that I may conceive a holy disgust for all that men in this World call good Letters, and deep Learning. Let me not stay in this Circumference, but let all my Views be directed towards thee, the Centre and the Source, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all that is true and lovely in the World. Let it suffice me to see thee, in whom I shall behold all things besides that can be seen. Let my Soul recollect all her strengths, and set them on this only Object, to penetrate it, if it be but possible. Aid me, O God, in this Design; make thy self visible, and let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the bottom of thy Mysteries, and in the secrets of thy divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that I may neglect, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of me, all other curious Sciences of which the men of this World make such mighty Boasts and Clutter.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The last Source of Indevotion; the Rarity and Interruption of holy Exercises.</head>
                  <p>I Acknowledge, the foregoing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles are very strong. The Love of the World, its Pleasures, its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, its Occupations, and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Mind; these are Evils to which it is hard to find a Remedy; but not so hard, if we would take more care and pains about it; for the most evident cause of our Indevotion, is the rarity and interruption of our holy Excercises; it is certain that spiritual Pleasures are most opposite to carnal Ones: and 'tis only rarity and difficulty make them sharp and uneasie; we lose the very tast of Pleasures, in the frequent use of them, and when once they have lost the grace of Novelty, they ahve lost their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42872:72"/> Value. This Beggar yesterday thought himself blest with a little Sum, but to day he has found a great one, and to morrow will be sensible no more of his happiness. Make great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments at a great distance, and the pleasure will be something, but make them every day, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Feast will end by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinary. But on the contrary, come often to God, renew your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces with him, and that which seemed at first both cold and dull, will certainly become at length an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of great delight, you come but seldom, and you quickly lose all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. The reason is not hard to find; it is, that Piety and its Exercises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Labours, because of the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal dispositions Sin puts us in. Now Labour decreases by a continual use: The Traveller is very weary at the end of his first Journey, but to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it will be less, and the next day his labour will be proportion'd to his strength, and within a few weeks
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42872:72"/> will become his diversion. Let us bring our Souls by Violence to God, at first they will follow with great pain, they will think the ways both hard and sharp, but after a little while, the toil will not be so great, but will change by degrees into pleasure. Is it not true that the less we do a thing, the worse it is done? Vertues are Habitudes; and though God gives them us, by infusing them into our Souls, yet he gives them in the same manner. Habits are usually acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; namely, by divers repeated Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, As therefore a Man is not a good Soldier, for having been once at War; nor a Painter for having received two or three good Lessons in that Art; no more is Piety acquir'd by some few acts feebly reiterated, but by long and frequent Exercise. 'Tis a War in which we are to combat with our own Thoughts, and against the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our own Hearts. And if we be repulsed the first and second Charge, we must incessantly return again with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42872:73"/> fresh Vigour. Indevotion is a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, we must kill by little and little, since 'tis not to be done at one blow, nor at one time. This day we must gain a step, and to morrow another; but if we suffer him to take the least breath, he will quickly recover what he lost. And when we are come just to the conquering him entirely, we must not slacken any thing of our diligence; for if the rarity of devout Exercises hindred its progress, were it never so far advanced, an interruption or relaxation will quite destroy it. 'Tis hard to compass any Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but 'tis quickly lost for want of Exercise: especially when we stir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our natural Inclinations, to which if we yield never so little place, we shall find our selves ready to take their part, a little after. Our hearts are bent towards Sin, and especially towards Indevotion. Let it be never so well fortified, or confirmed with the best Habits in the World, one heated and disordred Thought, that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42872:73"/> crosses it, will set it all on fire, and with the flames of Concupiscence, stifle the flames of its Devotion; but if it catches thus the fire of Sin so easily, it is on the other hand, heavy and cold to all Devotion: So that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having with abundance of Art and Labour and great Toil, rais'd it to heavenwards, an interruption of a few days will let it sink again into its old Abyss. And for proof of this, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no other witnesses than the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely devout Souls. If some Affairs of the World, and some Impediments, which you call Insurmountable, have estranged you somewhile from the places of Devotion, and made you lose your Closet-hours: You are at first uneasie, but you insensibly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom your selves to it, and when you have a mind to return to your good Practices, and exercise of Prayer, then you can hardly find your selves, and feel an inconceivable sloth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness upon your Hearts. Conscience is like the Stomach, leave giving it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42872:74"/> any Victuals for a while, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will desire none; stay a little longer and if you give it any, 'twon't know what to do with it, it can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest no more, it will have lost its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, and all its Forces will be spent, and performing none of its Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it will let the Body die. So Conscience loses its habits of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by leaving off its operations, and the Soul dies in its sins. In a word, Devotion is a Vertue that puts in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the powers of the Soul, like the great wheel of a Watch, it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all the rest in going on: without discontinuing, all will go easily; but if you cease, the Wheels will run down, and all will be heavy and unfit for motion: Continue constantly the exercise of Piety, and the Soul will keep its dispositions to devout Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: interrupt them, and there will be a stoppage in the Soul, that will take away its facility of moving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42872:74"/>
                  <p>These are I think, very near all the greatest Sources of our Indevotions, and the Indispositions of the Soul, which must be mended and set right, before we can open the way to this excellent Vertue. We may find a great many others, I make no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they will throw us into too general Considerations. Who can doubt, for Example, that the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guors of our Souls come from the weakness of our Faith, our Hope, our Charity? Were we but strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that there is a God above that knoweth all our Thoughts, sees all our Ways, and calls himself the King of Men and Angels, that opens Heaven and Hell: could we present our selves before him, without the Spirit of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and a saving Fear? But alas, we believe in such a feeble manner, that we have great need of Gods help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Unbelief: to be pious, we only want to be Believing; and therefore the Fathers have thought no Advice more useful to keep us from Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42872:75"/> than this, to remember our selves <hi>of him,</hi> and call to mind, <hi>to whom</hi> we speak. And can we yet doubt but that this flowness of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief comes from the little love we have to God? Were we enflamed with the divine Love, all our movements would be made by the impressions of this heavenly Fire. In fine, if the hopes of Glory touch'd our Hearts but never so little, we should not move so slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards him, from whom we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to receive eternal Happiness. But I know not how we should reckon this amongst the Sources of Indevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since this want of Faith and Hope, and Charity, are Indevotion it self.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we must own, that we find in our selves, certain Indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of mind, very often, of which we cannot tell the cause. To day we are all Heat, and to morrow all Ice: A good Soul presses upon it it self, rouses it self, and thinks on every thing that can enkindle its Affections,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42872:75"/> seeks for it self, but finds it not; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines its Conscience to find out its Offences that have disingag'd its Heart from God, and grieved the holy Spirit of Grace. She finds nothing she can accuse her self of, and knows not to what she can attribute this her Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Whence come these Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? it may be from the changeable nature of Man, that is never long the same. It may be the temperament of humours in the Body, and disposition of the Air. As the Soul is Prisoner in the Body, and acteth by its Organs, and depends extremely on the stirring of its several Humors, it is manifest that Devotion depends in some measure on these springs of Blood and Dust, which are so often out of order: it may be that the Devil hath found his time▪ and sowed his Tares amongst the good Seed. In fine, it may be that the Spirit of God, the Author of all good Thoughts hath for some season hid himself. This driness of Soul may come from hence, that God hath shut
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42872:76"/> the Sources and the Springs of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that rise up to everlasting Life. But be it as it will, this Evil does no little mischief to devout Souls. We can employ no other means to the curing it but Prayers and Tears. The Soul must say, Come, thou Lord Jesus, come, Sun of my Soul, dissipate this darkness, cause thou the Morning-star to arise in my Heart: Why dost thou hide thy self, I seek thee in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>season, and find thee not: Open thy Fountains, that I may quench my Thirst, and be refreshed and satisfied; hast thee, O God of my Salvation.</p>

                     <p>I do acknowledge my great Negligence. I take a great deal of pains, to do every thing well that respects this present Life, and take so little, to do the only and the principal thing for which I ought to labour, that 'tis hard to imagine it. To succeed in any Art, I exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it frequently; I consult my Masters, I reflect on my Mistakes, to the end I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them no more. But, Oh my Soul, thou
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42872:76"/> takest not half this care in the exercises of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: Thou dost them seldom, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any reflexion at all, and therefore dost them very ill: thou dost them seldom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou dost them without pleasure: and thou dost them without any profit, because thou dost them without any zeal or application: Return, my Soul, more frequently, return, and thou shalt find Pleasures and Joys un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, and inconceivable.</p>

                     <p>O my Lord God, my heavenly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, open thou the Fountains of thy Grace, and let those streams flow down to me. Make me sensible of the advantages of possessing thee, and of the pleasures that the enjoyment of thy heavenly goods will bring; that I may not drag my self so seldom and with so much difficulty, to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es where thou speakest unto me, or to the Closet where thou sufferest me to meet and entertain thee. Draw me that I may run after thee; when I design to approach thee by the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Devotion: O do not thou withdraw thy self from me. <hi>I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42872:77"/> know I am not worthy, thou shouldst en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under my Roof.</hi> It is not long since that my heart was a Den of Thieves: and a rendevouz of cursed Spirits; Thou hast driven them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by thy Celestial Grace; but those uncleanly Guests have left the relicks of impurity behind, that make it an unfit abode for thee, and for thy holiness. But, O thou Sun of my Soul, whose Rays cannot be sullied with the impurity of those places where they enter: Pierce thou into my very inwards; carry thy flames within, and kindle in my heart the flames of thy Love. If I am sleepy, waken me; if I fall into Negligence, and come to break off my Devotions, knock at the door of my Heart; and if thy Word cannot be heard, spare not to rouse me by Afflictions: Break me in pieces, rather than permit me to continue in my natural hardness; thy Wounds will never break my Head, but will be more sweet than precious Balms. Come to my aid, O my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that I may accomplish the Victory over my infirmities. I am heavy and earthly, make thou me
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42872:77"/> spiritual and light. The Movements of Grace and Devotion, that lift me upon high, are opposite to the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nature that drag me down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In this dispute I am rent and torn in twain: the Corruption of Nature has the insolence to oppose it self to thy Grace; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test causes the sedomness of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions. But, O thou heavenly Spirit, make them easie and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that I may oftner return to them.</p>

                  <p>WE have thus examined the Sources of Indevoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; We have tried to compass them: but amongst the rest there is one more lively, more open, and more fruitful in Impurities, and by consequence a greater Enemy to Piety, and that's the Spirit of the World; and after having thought
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42872:78"/> upon the matter well, we find the Spirit of the World, is the love of sensual Pleasure. Experience shews us that this Spirit, is such an Enemy of Devotion, that 'tis impossible to be animated therewith, and be truly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout: This continual use of sensual Pleasures fixes the Soul so strongly to its matter, that the Heart becomes incapable of Elevation. The closer Union we have with sensible Things, the more our Union with God dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth. We must therefore turn our greatest strength towards that side, and try to bring our Soul back to our God, and pluck it from that fast Hold it has taken on material things, that it may apply it self to God, and be wholly taken up with him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though our too great sensibility of the pleasures of this Earth, hath already had its Chapter; amongst the other Sources of Indevotion, we do not think we have said as yet enough on that great Subject. The Monster is too dreadful to be combated with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42872:79"/> Negligence, and slightly: if we could rid our selves of this, we had done all, but if it still continue Master, we shall attempt in vain to be good <hi>Devouts.</hi> And therefore I design in this Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Second Part, to offer such Considerations as may, if it be possible, destroy this mighty Enemy of true Devotion.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that Man is born for Pleasure, since he is created to be happy, and that happiness consists in the possession of Good, and in the sense of that Possession that causes Pleasure. The Sovereign good of man consists in possessing of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately united to him in a very intimate manner; and that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the sense of which makes up compleat happiness, must spring from the intimate Union with the Divinity: This Union is made, by Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and by Love; and the pleasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises from hence, that God applies to the Soul, whilst he embraces it, the side of his Goodness, and Beauty, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42872:79"/> fills it with his Light, and spreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his Joys and Comforts through it. Sin hath so enfeebled this Union of the Soul with God, that it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tasts these pleasures. <hi>Your sins have made a separation betwixt God and you,</hi> Isa. 59.2. And it hath made as it were a thick Cloud, that hides from our eyes that Sun, whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Rays cause so much Joy in strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through us. The Soul hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd this Sentiment still, that she is born for Pleasure and Delight; so that when she is disunited from God, and depriv'd of the pleasure of that Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, she turns her wholly to the Bodies side, and the closer she is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it and Pleasures, the farther she is from God: So 'tis the pleasures of the Senses that disunites the Soul from God: as this disunion is properly that Indevotion which we fight and strive against; for most assuredly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is the movement of the Soul, by which it returns to its Principle, and to the enjoyment of those Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42872:80"/> that flow from an Union with God. Let the men of this World take but the pains to consult their Hearts hereon and they will tell them, what we have said is very true; they will find the reason why they could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose themselves to Prayer to love and serve God, was, because they were possessed by their Passions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted by the illusions of Sense; that is to say, they are absolutely turn'd to worldly Pleasures side, and are wholly taken up by them. The Soul is straitned, the Mind is bounded when it is filled with the World and its Vanities: and we must not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if God, who will have the Soul entire, find no place therein.</p>
                  <p>In a word, we shall undertake a very difficult Task to persuade those that will become truly Devout, that they ought to renounce the pleasures of the World. Though the Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption be exceeding great, yet we may not place all pleasures in the same rank of Evil; we distinguish two sorts
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42872:80"/> of sensual Pleasures: There are some we call Excesses, Enormities, and Crimes; the World, 'tis true, gives it self up to these, but dare not however undertake the Defence of them. Others there are which we call Innocent Delights, such as Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Play, Debauches, good Chear, great Entertainments, Feasting, Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, Shows, and disorderly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, Commerces of Galantry, and such Intrigues, as are the ready ways to the last impurities of criminal Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The Church distinguishes these Pleasures as well as the World, and both agree that some of them are Innocent; but the Church accounts the greatest part of these pleasures to be Criminal, whose innocence the World supports and maintains. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is an Idol to which all the World sacrifices, Young and Old, Men and Women, great and small, rich and poor, all Ages, Sexes &amp; Conditions love Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. So that if we count up Voices, we shall lose our Cause; the Young
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42872:81"/> especially cannot endure that we should take from them the use of Pleasure, to which they think Youth should be consecrated and devoted: Painter and Poets, that contribute to the corrupting the Mind, represent to us Pleasures, as a young Man or Maid, laid on a bed of Flowers, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd with all those Objects from whence the pleasures of the Body are deriv'd. The Passions that are all Carnal, and have a strict alliance with the Sense, are boyling hot in Youth: the Flesh, that is vigorous and as yet hath received no Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, domineers with Insolence. And therefore Youth follows the Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the Transports of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament; The sentiments of Piety and the habits of Vertue are not to be look'd for there, so that Reason desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of those Helps is easily vanquished by the Passions. Nay, one may say that Reason conspires with the Passions in that Age, and serves but to throw them into greater Excesses. They reason in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42872:81"/> their manner, they persuade themselves that Wisdom is not so becoming Youth, but is rather the lot of those that are growing Old; and they abuse that saying of the Wiseman; <hi>There is a time for every business under Heaven.</hi> If some of them are are otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, they are afraid to follow those better Motions, they are struck with a criminal kind of Shame, and are loth to be remarkable for their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. They throw themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Croud, and are carried away by the stream: and even those that are called the Wise ones of the World, if they dare not authorise these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, they at least excuse them. They are Young, say they, they will return again, we must indulge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Age; one is not born Wise, we have been as they are, and they will one day be, as we are now.</p>
                  <p>But alas, we do not stop here, we renounce not to Pleasure, when we are past our Youth, the love of that is a Distemper that we carry with us
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42872:82"/> in all Ages, we yield as late as we possibly can, or to say truth, never. Age and Distempers sometimes fasten men to Pleasures, but very seldom make them give them over; this is the hardest and the rarest thing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. How often do we see Women that are resolv'd to hold out against Time, and that catch hold of every thing they can light on, not to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the stream; they omit no manner of way to conserve the Air of Youth; they would deceive men, and it may be they think of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death too. They would always be the Object of the Love of this World, that they may have their shares of its Pleasures, and when Age is come and hath spread its marks upon their Hew, they draw a Curtain over it to render the defects invisible. You may see them Idolatresses of the World, burying their Heads under a heap of Powder, to mingle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the whiteness of their Gray, with the white of their Powders; they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42872:82"/> fill up the hollowness of their Face; and shadow the wrinckles of their Brows with Curls and Ribbands, Nets and Points that which they do the best, is that they Embalm their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and cover them with Sweets, to hinder the ugly Smells that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from their just living Carcasses: and in this Dress, they mix with all Company, and will be parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in every merry Meeting. We see them at Balls, and at the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, trembling with weakness; tho they have not sight enough to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish red from black, nor a Cater from a Deuce, yet they must play at Cards and Dice, although it be with Spectacles. In a word, after they have been the Idols of the World, they chastise the Faults they made it commit, they become its punishment, and are its Abomination. They are Spectres and Fantoms that pursue and scare it, and it flies them, and has them in abhorrence.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:42872:83"/>
                  <p>But are the Men ever the Wiser? Do we not see too among them, Old Sinners, perfectly worn out with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, but yet whose Lusts and Desires are young and boyling? Their Inclinations are continually Vicious, though their Bodies will obey them no longer in being the Ministers of their polluted Pleasures. Methinks, in considering them, I see with my self, what happens after the burning of a House; when the main Fire hath ceased, we see a great while after, sparks and little flames pierce through the heaps of Rubbish; this lets us see the Fire is still alive and only wants more matter; and so it is with these Old men, they are but a heap of warm Ashes, and the relicts of a Fire, but in the midst of these Ashes we see from time to time, Efforts of vile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence are made, that let us see, the love of Pleasure still lives within, and that the Body only wants its strength to put those impotent Desires in act.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42872:83"/>
                  <p>All men then are on Pleasures side; and they are not content to defend it by plurality of Votes, but would maintain it by Arguments of Reason. They tell us God and Nature do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vain, the Earth is covered with Creatures, the Sea is fill'd with Fish, the Air with Fowls, and the whole World with Pleasures. Is it possible for God who made them for our service, to forbid us the use of them? Hath the Author of Nature done so many sensible Wonders, to fill the Senses with Illusions, and excite in them criminal Affections? Hath God inscribed on every Creature, <hi>Touch it not?</hi> At this rate, the Condition of a Man is exceedingly miserable: when he was in Paradise, there was but one Tree, that was forbidden him to tast, and now are all things in the World become as so many mortal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruits, that we must not touch but die the Death? How suits it with the Wisdom and the goodness of God to place man amidst so many Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42872:84"/> if he cannot fall into any one without sin? Is there not a natural Bond and Tie betwixt Love and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, betwixt Desires and Things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable? And why should God have made so many Things so lovely and so good, if he design'd to forbid men their enjoyment or desiring them? Alas, there are too many Evils una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, why should we search for others, that we cannot shun? And if the good Things of this World are not the Rewards of good and happy men, they are at least the Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Miserable, as says S. <hi>Austin.</hi> Why should we not enjoy these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights that are the sweetnings and the Solaces of all their pains? Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Joy, you take away their Life. What, would you bury men alive? Is not this to make this Life a sad and melancholy Night? In a word, do you not make poor man the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablest Creature in the World? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not so severe, and stuck with so many Thorns, as we would make
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42872:84"/> believe, if you ascend to its Original, you will find, say they, Religion, much more pure and disingaged from the Rigours Superstition cloathed it withal. The Saints have had their Excesses and have given God thanks for a Table well covered; for a full Bowl and an overflowing Cup. They have said, That Wine was design'd <hi>to make glad the heart of Man:</hi> Our Lord himself the Author of the true Religion, hath had his Feastings, and went to the Marriage-Dinner, and there made excellent Wine to give the Guests good entertainment. 'Tis thus they plead for Pleasure, and the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is, these Maxims are not only vented abroad in the World, but we are trying to bring them into the Church. We have Directors fitted for the purpose, that deck Religion with Flowers; that cry, <hi>Make strait the paths, and smooth the rugged ways,</hi> Enlarge the Road, that all the World may walk therein: they make Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion easie for us, and are full of. <hi>My
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42872:85"/> koke is easie, and my burden light.</hi> Love maketh easie our Lords Yoke, for all is easie, all is sweet to him that loves; but these bad Masters make their Yokes easie by dispensing with the Love of God, and suffering men to love the World, and follow its Delights. And the reason why, both in the World and Church there are so very few truly Devout, is because there are so very many Lovers and pursuers of Pleasure.</p>

                     <p>Wretch that I am! I do not the good I would, but the evil that I would not, that I do. I understand very well the force of the reasons of Religion, that call me to renounce the pleasures of this VVorld, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Pleas of all their Advocates: but all these Reasons find the Door shut, because my heart is set against them: and those bad reasonings that maintain the use of Pleasure enter easily, because they are allied to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of my heart. My flesh is troubled to find the reasons of Piety so strong, and would
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42872:85"/> be glad that those of Pleasure should be better. And my Soul is grieved, when it sees the force of Truth, and finds in its self an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to yield. I seriously bewail my state that tho I see the weakness of the Reasons that sway me on the side of Pleasure, yet can I not hinder my self from being carried away by them, as though they were very good and sound ones. For Piety and Reason get nothing by joyning Forces, Passion, Almighty Passion, always is victorious. O my Soul, thou art a fond Idolater of pleasure; 'tis to no purpose for thee to shift places, thou carriest thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities along with thee. If thou renouncest any Pleasure, thou dost not quit thy Idolatry, but only changest the Object of thy worship. For the love of Pleasure finds out ways to be sure to lose nothing, but for one Object lost provides thee with another. Judge then of what nature thy Devotions must needs be, when thou dividest them betwixt thy Idols and thy God. O take that part my Soul, that good part, that shall not be taken from thee, thou canst not serve two Masters, God and the World. It may be thou rejoycest that thou hast renounc'd the pleasures of thy Youth, in that thou lovest no longer Balls and Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Plays: but thou perceivest not, that Corruption ties thee to some other Objects, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42872:86"/> that thou art a slave to thy passions, and the Cheat and Property of thy own heart. In thy Youth thou tookest pleasure to scatter abroad thy Money, but now thou takest delight in heaping it together. VVhat difference is there betwixt these two pleasures? Are they not both pleasures of Sence? Have they not both one Source, to wit, that source of sensible things? Do they not produce the same effect, and separate thee from God? A Young man that gives himself to the excess of youthful Pleasures, should he value himself because he plays not at Cherry-stones and Pushpin, as he did when he was a Boy? Every Age of life hath its peculiar passions and pleasures, but all in general are Enemies to Devotion. Be not therefore troubled to know what it is that makes thee sleep at Sermons, 'tis the Devil of Pleasure and Delight that rocks thee; when thou ceasest to be attentive at thy Prayers, 'tis he that plucks thee by the Ears, and carries thee astray, and if thou feelest no delight in the presence of God that unites himself imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately unto thee: it comes from hence, that thou art plung'd and overwhelm'd in Matter, and being entirely in the Interests of corporal and carnal things, thou thinkest there is nothing real, but what thou feelest, and knowest of no true Joys, but what proceed from things
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42872:86"/> sensible. Re-enter then, my Soul, re-enter then thy self, permit these bodily Objects, no longer to dazle the Eyes of thy Understanding; seek for the presence of thy God: hearken to the Eternal Wisdom that speaks to thee in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of thy heart: Resist the attempts which the flesh makes to destroy thee. Believe not the report of thy Senses, take not those for true Delights, they offer to thee. Look upon nothing which thou seest, as worthy of thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and esteem; let God be all in all and fill thy heart, and take it wholly up. And if thou appliest thy self to him, he will do so to thee, and from this mutual Application, will proceed pleasures so great that thy Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot well conceive them.</p>

                     <p>My Lord and my God; what shall I render to thee for so many Favors, and what shall I do to expiate so many ingratitudes? Thou hast plac'd me in a Paradise where all good things abound; Thou hast ordain'd me Master of all the works of thy hand, and hast given me the use of all I see; Thou hast made all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42872:87"/> sensible that they may have some agreement with my Senses, and may be as steps to raise me to things intelligible, but by reason of my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption they are become snares: I make no use of the visible Creatures to ascend to things not seen; but I make use of them to descend below my self; I immerse my self in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and bury my self in bodily things. And so I make my Mind a slave to its Body. The Heaven and Earth, the Sea and Air, are fill'd with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that might serve to make me know thee, that I might admire and praise thee, but I use them only to offend thee: All things are full of Objects to flatter and please the Senses: but, O my God, thou hast not made them with design, that I should there seek for sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and intoxicate my self with joys, and corporal Delights. Thou hast made, by thy profound Wisdom and by thy infinite Power, the Fishes of the Sea, the Creatures of the Earth, Plants and several Fruits, with many precious Liquors and all for the tast: Perfumes for the Smell,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42872:87"/> and Beauties for the Eyes, Sounds for the Ears, and several pleasures much for the Touch. I am assured, O my God, that thou hast done all this to save, and not destroy me; had I remained innocent, and in the state thou createdst me, I could not thus have abused all thy Goods, in using and possessing them: I might then have used them, because this use should not have abased and brought down my Mind to sensible things, by dividing me from thee, but I might still have continued perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to thee. But now the Devil hath spread abroad his snares in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Creature, and fixed temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on every Object of my Sense. Thou seest then, O my God, thou seest me surrounded with Tempters on all hands; I cannot open my Eyes, nor hearken with my Ears, but I perceive some Image that awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens my corrupt imagination and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments my wicked desires. O Son of God, O holy Ghost, be you the Guardians of my Heart; let me van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish these Temptations; O favour me so far, as to recall thy Creatures
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42872:88"/> to their true and right use, that I may not abuse them: let me know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them, that I may wonder at thy Power, and praise thy Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that from these corporal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages I may draw spiritual ones, and find thee in all thy Creatures, and my heart may more and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to thee, thou Infinite, Eternal Spirit.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That the pleasures of the Sense, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their use, nor abuse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Spirit of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Devotion.</head>
                  <p>I Know very well this Maxim must appear strange to the greatest part of men; and particularly to those that are prepossess'd with the Opinions we have been examining in the foregoing Chapter. The Maxims of the Church are opposite to those of the World, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42872:88"/> light is to darkness. The World au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorises all sensual pleasures, the Church condemns them almost all; We do not therefore simply form our Process against those Debauches, whose name is odious even in the World; but we condemn even those that are called good and honest Folks, who indeed have some degree of moral Honesty, and whose lives are free from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Laws taking hold on them, but who throw away their lives in the vain pleasures of this World. All these pleasures that we think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, are Enemies of Devotion, and accord not at all with the Spirit of Christianity neither in their use, nor their abuse: and if we cannot render this truth Victorious by plurality of Voices, let us at least make it evident by the force of Reason.</p>
                  <p>First, Let us hear our Lord Christ speaking to this matter, for where can we find the <hi>Spirit of Christianity,</hi> better than in Christ Jesus himself? Hear him then describing the Way that leads to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42872:89"/> Life. <hi>Wide is the gate and broad the way that leads to Death, and many there are that enter therein: for strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leads to life. If thou wouldst be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and follow me. If any one will come after me, let him take up his Cross and follow me. If thine Eye offend thee, or thy right Hand, pluck it out, and cut it off, and cast it behind thee. Blessed are the poor: Blessed are they that hunger and thirst: Blessed are those that mourn, and are persecuted.</hi> And have not the Disciples followed their Master here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Do they not say also? <hi>Mortifie therefore your members that are on Earth. If any one loveth the World, the love of the Father dwelleth not in him. Be ye sober and watch, and be not ye conformable to this present World. As Strangers and Pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts. Be not partakers of the unfruitful works of darkness. Make not the Temples of the holy Ghost, the members of an Harlot.</hi> The
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42872:89"/> Spirit of the Prophets differed not from that of the Apostles. <hi>Behold, I said of Joy it is madness, and of Laughter it is folly. It is better for a man to go into the house of mourning, than of feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to heart. It is good for a man that he bear the Yoke in his youth. I said in mine heart, go to now I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure, and behold, this also is Vanity. Rejoice O young man, in the time of thy youth, but know that for all these things God will bring thee to Judgment.</hi> And now, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, are these the Characters of the Christians of our times? These Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Thorns, these hard Ways, these strait Gates, this Yoke, this renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the World and all its Pomps and Vanities, do they signifie that we may follow our Lord Jesus Christ, with all our train of Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; sometimes amidst our Feasts, sometimes at Balls, sometimes at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, sometimes at Plays? These
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42872:90"/> soft effeminate Lives, that are spent at Cards and Dice, in vain and criminal Conversations, in Intrigues of sensual Love; have they any agreement with the Combats, the Wrestlings, and the Races, from which the holy Spirit bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows Emblems to express the life of a Christian by? <hi>So fight, so run that ye may obtain, and bear away the Prize. Mortifie therefore your flesh, and bring it under subjection. So fight ye, not as beating the Air.</hi> Heaven and Earth, Life and Death, are in no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opposition than the Effeminate life of Christians, and the pourtrait of their life drawn by the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But above all let us remember often that the Spirit of Christianity and of Devotion loves nothing so well as Mortification, to which the pleasures of the Sense are deadly Enemies: <hi>Mortifie therefore your members that are on Earth,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> and is this the way to mortifie your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by feeding them with Pleasures, by laying them on Beds of Down, by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42872:90"/> ransacking both Sea and Land to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with delicate Provisions; by joining Art with Nature in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing precious Liquors, and running after every thing that may enchant the Senses? Some will say that by these <hi>Members,</hi> of which the Gospel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins the Mortification, we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Vices:</hi> which I grant. But you know very well that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body, are the Origine and as it were the Seat of the members of the Old-man, that are the Vices. And we cannot kill Vice, but by mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Members. The Flesh is that unhappy Ground, accursed of God, that produceth Thorns and Briars; and the more you feed this Ground, the more it will produce these veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Plants. We are therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to keep this Ground as barren as we can of pleasures, that foment our Lusts, and bring forth such abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fruits.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:42872:91"/>
                  <p>The Spirit of Christianity and of Devotion, is a Spirit of Strength, but Pleasure is soft and weak, it loosens the Soul and effeminates the Courage, and the Church requires a vigorous Soul and a Heart of such a make, as cannot be hurt by the most weighty blows, or sharpest Swords of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it. We have to march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a hundred and a hundred drawn Swords, and he that will follow the truth of Christ, must resolve to suffer Persecution, because we have always the Devil and the World to cope with. But is a soft voluptuous Life proper, do you think, to dispose one for Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? when we rise from a Bed of Sweets, from a delicious Table, with our Heads full of the fumes of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, are we in a condition to go up to the Scaffolds, to enter the Flames, and look on Racks and Tortures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out terrour? Where would it be most reasonable to seek for the Heroes of Jesus Christ, that can meet Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, amongst the Christians of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42872:91"/> our days, that are drench'd in Pleasures, or amongst those whose rigorous, sharp, retir'd Life hath openly declared War to all the pleasures of the World? But we are not call'd, say men, to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, and according to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, never shall. That may be, but 'tis no matter, we must always be in a disposition of suffering Martyrdom, if need were. But besides, do we think that the Swords and fire of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, are any ways more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than Temptations? We think we have need of great strength and courage, to endure Punishments only. But alas, he that went off victorious from these bloody Combats, hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fall'n into the Devils Nets: Men that have carried in their Bodies the glorious Marks of the Lord Jesus, have since become the Sons of Wrath, by suffering themselves to be surpriz'd, by the Devil of Pride, of Avarice, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness and Heresie. He that had rent a Lion in twain by his mighty strength, and slain the <hi>Philistines</hi> by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42872:92"/> whole Troops, with the Jaw-bone of an Asse, fell by the wiles of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lila,</hi> and was carried in Chains to the Temple of her Idol. This Truth is not unknown to the World: 'Twas well said that the Delights of <hi>Capua</hi> did more than the <hi>Roman</hi> Sword, and found the way of softning and of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hard <hi>Africans</hi> that followed <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and carried victory in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph after them. Thus the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity God gives us should not make us sleep in the Arms of Pleasure: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity is a powerful Temptation, and Pleasure it self a Monster that we can not vanquish without a vigorous and brave Resistance.</p>

                     <head>MEDITATION.</head>
                     <p>'Tis a very hard and troublesome Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, this, that God will judge us both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we shall have done, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we would have done, had we been exposed to those temptations which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence spar'd us from. 'Tis so true, there is no room left us to doubt of it. 'Tis certain, that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42872:92"/> our God would have the highest purity of heart imaginable; that one is not innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, because he hath done no evil, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath had no inclinations to commit it. He sounds and knows the bottom of the Reins, and will judg according to what he knows and not according to what men see. He sees our Faults even budding in our hearts, and if our Faults shall not spring forth for want of Earth, if they do not produce effects for want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, we are not therefore innocent. But who on the other side can bear the terror of this Thought. I may then be punish'd for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Faults that I have never actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: it will be to no purpose to find my life clear'd, of Paricide and Sacrilege, Adulteries, Idolatry, and of Apostacy. Since I may have in me their seed sown in my heart. How canst thou answer this to thy self, my Soul? Thou art deep, and profoundly wicked, who can know thee? Canst thou say with thy self, with any assurance, though I should see the beauty of <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> I would not fall into the unclean snares of <hi>David:</hi> though I should be tempted with <hi>Solomons</hi> temptations, yet would I not become like him a foul Idolater. Though I should see Death present to my Eyes, yet would I not deny my Master, like St. <hi>Peter.</hi> If these Pillars have been shaken, what assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42872:93"/> canst thou have thou shalt be able to withstand the storms of Temptations; Thou who art but a bruised Reed? And if I must be judg'd for all the sins I might commit, what will become of me? what shall I do, where shall I turn my self, since I cannot at present give account of what I have already done? Think for thy comfort, O my Soul, that if thou art capable of thy self of falling into sins of surprize, and yielding to temptations not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, thou art on the other side, by the strength of Gods grace within thee, and preserving thee, able also to rise again, and to go out and weep bitterly; so that if God looks on the sins thou wouldst commit if tempted, as committed, he looks upon them also as effac'd and blotted out by Repentance, which he sees thou wouldst have shewn, hadst thou committed them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, my Soul, let not this hinder thee from working out thy salvation with fear and trembling. Dread that severe and piercing Eye, that sees and knows the sins to come as well as what are past: that knows and hates the evil dispositions of thy heart, which thou knowest not thy self as yet, as well as those thou hast tried, and known: stifle those growing seeds of Vice, that they may never spread forth fruits of bitterness, and be imputed to thee as though they had produced fruits. Essay
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42872:93"/> my heart, to have within thee dispositions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all good works, and habitudes of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. And by these means although the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God presents thee not occasions to exercise those Vertues, his goodness yet will judge according to what thou wouldst have done, hadst thou had the means. If thou art poor and not in a condition to do Alms, the Judge will nevertheless say to thee; When I was hungry thou gavest me to eat, when I was thirsty drink, when naked thou hast clothed me. Yes I say, Thou hast done this, because thou wouldst have done it, if thou couldst.</p>

So that if thy Grace were not as a Bridle in my Heart, to restrain me, it would every hour fly out, and give it self to utter dissoluteness: So that I acknowledg, O my God, that I owe to thee all the good I have and do, and all the evil that I do not. <hi>I owe to thee,</hi> said great St. <hi>Austin, the forgiveness of all the sins I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42872:94"/> because thou hast pardoned them, I look moreover on all the sins I have not committed, as pardoned, because thy grace prevented me from committing them.</hi> This lets me understand how I must understand, that which thou my Saviour once saidst, that <hi>he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth least to whom least is forgiven.</hi> 'Twas to discover to that proud <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,</hi> Thou spakest to the Source of his Indevotion and his little love. He imagined he had less obligations to thy Mercy, because he had, as he thought, committed less sin. For my part, I believe he ought to love the most, to whom least is forgiven. Yes, my God, I am more obliged to thee, for the sins thou hindredst me from committing, than for those thou par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donedst when committed. 'Tis much the greater good, to make a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable, than afterwards to cure the wounds he has received. 'Tis better never to fall into the fire, and waters, than to be plucked out, though without receiving any hurt, and he is the happier Man that has been always well, than he that has been lately cur'd. But above all, since 'tis
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42872:95"/> a great misfortune to have sinned against thee, My God, it must be a greater good, to have been preserv'd from sin, by thy grace, than to re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into favour after having offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy most holy Majesty. Deliver me then, O my Redeemer, from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to come; prevent my sins, drain out the Sources of my Vices, take from my heart all evil Dispositions, and dispose it to all goodness, that I may be judg'd before thee, as having fulfill'd all Righteousness; that I may be rewarded for the good works I have done, because I had not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have done them, if I could.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Other Considerations on this Truth.</head>
                  <p>THE Pleasures of the World, are either of the Sense, or of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Now these Faculties are Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and therefore all their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are Corporeal: And this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42872:95"/> to say to such as would follow the Spirit of the Gospel, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawfully seek after them. For the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, leads men to the neglecting and despising of the Body, and always speaks of it with a kind of Contempt. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the style of the holy Ghost, the Body is but <hi>dust and ashes, an Earthy house, an house of Clay, that Worms shall feed on and destroy, a Flower that grows up in the morning and is cut down at even, a stream that passes away, a shadow that disappears, a dream that vanishes, a smoak that is lost whilst it ascends.</hi> And as he speaks with Contempt, so he would have us take as little care of it. <hi>Take no care for the Body,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, to obey it in the lusts thereof: Take no thought for the morrow,</hi> says our Lord, <hi>for the morrow shall take thought for it self, or for what ye shall eat or drink, or wherewith ye shall be clothed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for the Soul, the holy Ghost would have us turn all our cares on
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42872:96"/> that side; it would have us <hi>watch, and be sober,</hi> to keep the Soul, <hi>because the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour. He bids us work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> and would have us in perpetual care about it. He commands us to feed our Souls with the Milk of Understanding, pure and simple, and furnish them with solid Food. He would have us entertain them with continual Joy: and seek those noble Pleasures that are found in the possession of God, which are proper only to the Soul. The Gospel would have us dress and adorn them, that they may be as a fair Espouse without spot, and fit to be presented to our Lord the heavenly Bridegroom. Examine but the conduct of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men, how contrary it is to this: they act as though they were all flesh; and as if their Soul were but as so much Salt to keep the Body from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; all the Ideas that they have of Pleasure come to them from the
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:42872:96"/> Sense and Imagination, and they have no more conception of spiritual Joys, than blind men have of Colours. As therefore they have never tasted any other than corporeal Delights, they believe they are oblig'd to their Bodies for all their happiness. And in effect it is so, for at what time they tast their carnal pleasures, one cannot say they are not happy, since, happiness consists in Joys and Pleasures, and which they, for that moment are in possession of. Thus because we chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love what we consider as the Source of our Felicity, we must not think it strange, if these men of Pleasure love their Bodies, which they look on as the Sources of their Delights. We see, men have the same sentiments of their Bodies, as the Saints have for God, who is their Sovereign Good, and in whom they find their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Joy. They worship this Body, they cherish it, perfume it, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and offer Incense to it. And if you offer it any indignity, they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42872:97"/> are as jealous of it as of their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Nay, they have greater indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at him that hurts this Body, than at him that is a known Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or a sacrilegious Person. In a word, this Body is so very like their God, that they sacrifice all to it, even to their Consciences, nay even to God himself. But nothing is more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to Christianity and the Spirit of Devotion, than this Sentiment. For the true Christian is obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise his Body, to sacrifice it to his God, to see himself torn to pieces for his Names sake, and to renounce all sensual Pleasures for his sake.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of the Gospel absolutely tends to the contempt of the World, but the Spirit of sensual Pleasure tends to the love of it. How can we chuse but love the World, when it caresses us, when it does us so much good, and gives us so much pleasure, since we love it when it frowns upon us, when it persecutes, and fills our Cup with bitterness? The World is a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42872:97"/> great Cheat, and an inexhaustible spring of Illusions; it masks it self, and shews it self before us, under the Image of corporal Delight; it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces us with a Garment and Crown bedeck'd with Flowers, but then those Flowers have under them a thousand Prickles. We see not indeed these Prickles, but the Flowers only: we are only sensible of the pleasures, and love the cause from whence they spring. But all the World knows nothing is more opposite to Devotion, than the love of the World, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready let you see; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence there is nothing more opposite to the Spirit of Christianity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion than sensual Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would inspire a contempt of the present Life, and a desire of that to come. Now it is certain nothing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens us so much to this Life, as the pleasure of the Sense. The Saints still say and ought to say, <hi>I desire to be dissolv'd and to be with Christ, for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42872:98"/> this is much better. I know that when this earthy Tabernacle is dissolv'd, we have an house eternal in the Heavens, and therefore we desire to be clothed again with this heavenly House: None of these things move me, nor count I my life dear unto me. As the Hart panteth after the Brooks, so longeth my Soul after thee, O God. O when shall I appear before the presence of God?</hi> It is impossible that men who live in a perpetual use of Pleasures, should have such Sentiments as these. Every one desires to be happy, and when he is once so, or believes he is so, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not renounce that which he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the spring of his Happiness. These carnal Men think they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, whilst they are enjoying their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and have no other Ideas of Happiness than that which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in this present life. They hear a great many talk continually of another Life, and another sort of Happiness: but they have got a Habit of not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themselves to be affected, by
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42872:98"/> any other thing than Sense and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and so because this Life and this Happiness fall not under any Sense, nor can be well imagined, they can consider them no otherwise, than as imaginary Beings, that are nothing in respect of them, because they have no manner of Ideas of them; their Hearts (in a word) because they meet with nothing in this life but gross Earth, that is to say, abundance of prosperity, take deep rooting in it. Their Affections intoxicated with the pleasures of the Flesh, bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with sensible Objects; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire nothing beyond, because they wish for nothing that they know not of, or have not any clear distinct Ideas of. The Earth is become their Country, here they are naturaliz'd, and all the rest is to them a strange and unknown Region.</p>
                  <p>Let them therefore say, all that can possibly be said, 'Tis certainly a sad and evil preparation for Death, this continual use of Pleasures, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42872:99"/> the VVorld disputes for and maintains. <hi>O Death,</hi> saith the Wise man, <hi>how bitter is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee, to him that lives in peace with his good things.</hi> We live much better in a Palace, than a Prison, but 'tis more difficult to die in one, than in the other. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable is the thought of Death, how terrible its presence to the man that lives in pleasure! he looks upon it as a Judge, that is come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a sad Arrest, and like an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner that seizes on him to lead him to his Punishment. But for the good Christian that hath always kept his Body in subjection, and a privation of carnal pleasures; he looks on Death, as on a Messenger that brings him good News, that is coming to break down his Prison-walls, and leave him at liberty to fly to Heaven. The Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous ones are drag'd to Death, and catch hold of every thing they meet withal to hinder them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they yield indeed at last to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42872:99"/> but they yield with a very ill grace; those therefore who multiply to themseves sensual pleasures, do but make themselves Chains whose break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will cost them many a flood of Tears. But the Saints who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd the pleasures of this World will find no difficulty in leaving it, since they have already left all that was sweet and charming in it.</p>
                  <p>I would say here that sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are Enemies of Devotion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they absolutely take away all the relish of spiritual ones, which the faithful find in their conversing with God; if I had not already said as much, and if it were not evident by Reason and Experience. We know very well those people who are Slaves to sensual pleasures, look upon all that can be said of the pleasures of Devotion, as so many Fables. Tell them of the Delights that a faithful Soul tasts when God in secret is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Heart, of the sweetness it finds in meditating on the love he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42872:100"/> hath for us, or in the Contemplation of his Mysteries: and they think you are telling them of so many Dreams and Visions. 'Tis certain, one is no farther sensible of spiritual Joys, than one has renounc'd to carnal ones. And therefore 'tis we are so little affected with the delights of Prayer, and Contemplation, because we have so imperfectly renounc'd the pleasures of the Sense. We must own, that in this respect the Rich and Honourable are expos'd to great Temptations, their Condition, as they say, obliges them every day, to draw after them a train of Pleasures; if this be so, they are unhappy: and in view of this, our Lord might well say, <hi>How hard is it for a Rich man to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God!</hi> Riches and Honours are continual Temptations to Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness, and hard it is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tempted and never fall: But Temperance and Moderation on the other hand, are also worthy of great Praises, when they preserve a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42872:100"/> so many Enemies that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd his ruin: This is very rare, but therefore Devotion is so too amongst such as think themselves oblig'd by their degree and Rank to live continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Pleasures.</p>
                  <p>In fine, if it is, as certainly it may be, permitted to draw Proofs from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, we can easily prove, that the Spirit of Devotion and Christianity are Enemies to sensual Pleasures. Which, do you think, do better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Spirit of Christianity; the Christians of our Age, that take such liberty as strict Morality would call <hi>Libertinism,</hi> or the Christians of the past Ages that liv'd a very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and austere Life? Abundance have there been, who not finding in the World a place of Retreat secure enough against the Temptations of Pleasure, have sought one in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts, where they might meet with none but pure and harmless Objects. Others have clad themselves in Hair and Sackcloth; Others have still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42872:101"/> amongst Company, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd Fasting and Mortification to all the pleasures of the Sense. Do ye think these men were wiser than we, or we than they. I know you will not stick at this, but place these Rigours and Austerities amongst the fruits of Enthusiasm, and illusions of the spirit of Errour. But sure, this is a rash judgment from which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Gods Tribunal, to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it belongs of right to distinguish, in austere lives, <hi>Sincerity</hi> from <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But would we have an Example that is not subject to mistakes? Let us look then on our Lord Jesus, whose life had nothing common with the pleasures of the Sense. You see him born in a Stable, brought up in a Carpenters House, fasting forty days in the Wilderness, and living upon the Alms of the Women that followed him. We hear him telling us, <hi>he had not where to lay his head.</hi> We see him going on foot from place to place:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42872:101"/> now, in good earnest, does this savour of the spirit of the World and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Life? Who better knows what the Spirit of Christianity should be, than Jesus Christ himself, and what are the effects of Devotion, than he who was perfectly devoted to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? After all this, don't tell me, that our Lord was not an Enemy of Pleasures, because we find him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at Festivals and Marriages: How were it to be wish'd our Saviour were at all our Festivals! One should not see such madness and debauchery reign there, but Wisdom, Temperance, Soberness, and the greatest Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be, would come along with that divine Guest.</p>

                     <p>My Soul, since thou art then encompassed with so great a Cloud of Witnesses, run with patience the Race that is set before thee. Since thou art shewn the way by so many great and holy Examples, thou needs must imitate and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42872:102"/> follow them. VVouldst thou follow an <hi>Elias</hi> in the Desart, a <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount, and fasting forty days, and be fed with bread by the Ravens, and drink of the Brook? But these are particular Calls that respect not thee at all; but if any one will follow <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> be cloath'd in Camels skin, and wear a leathern Girdle, and live on Locusts and wild Hony; Say not of him, <hi>because he cometh neither eating nor drinking, he hath a Devil.</hi> Take heed of making such rash judgments: those that come to exhort men to Repentance, should preach up Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, both by their actions, words, their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and their food. Thou hast need, my Heart, to mortifie and to repent thy self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twould be well thy Body were cloath'd in Sackcloth and Hair. But this Example, thou wilt say, of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> maketh not a Law, and if God hath not commanded it thou canst not be oblig'd to it. Take then another Example, another model much more perfect, and such as thou shouldst follow, the Example of thy Lord and Saviour, the Pattern in whose steps thou needs must tread. O live like him, and 'twill be well enough: the Disciple must not look to be greater than his Master: He lived <hi>in</hi> the VVorld, but he was not <hi>of</hi> the VVorld: he eat and drank, to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42872:102"/> give Examples of Sobriety: he conversed with men, to teach them to speak soberly and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for he opened not his mouth, but to Teach and Edifie. He is the model of all that thou shouldst suffer, all that thou shouldst do, and all thou shouldst leave undone. Suffer as he did patiently the scorns and Outrages of the VVorld: Drink as he did with the Spirit of submission the Cup of Gods Anger, when he presents it to thee: Do the good works he did; Employ the day in doing good to those that are afflicted, and the Night in Prayers: and let thy meat and drink be to do the Will of thy Father that is in Heaven: Abstain as he did from the pleasures of the World: lay his Cross upon thee, and mortifie sin in the flesh, since thy Saviour mortified his. <hi>If any one loves me,</hi> said he, <hi>let him come after me and follow me.</hi> But, O my Soul, how far art thou from him! how imperfect is thy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, and how short dost thou come of thy great Pattern! But lose not Courage; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, march on, leave all things else behind, and tend to what is before thee! the holy Spirit sent by thy Saviour, will conduct thee in that hard and difficult way, as in a Country that is at peace and quiet. If thou canst not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the perfection of that great Model, which God hath set before thine Eyes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42872:103"/> at least as near as thou canst, for if thou wouldst be happy as he was, thou must be just and holy as he was, thou must enter in at the strait Gate, and walk in the VVay of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, to arrive at that life of which he is the Author and the Source. The Soul of thy Saviour was not only depriv'd of all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Sense, but was also pierced through with many Sorrows. To imitate him thou must renounce too all carnal Delights, and submit thy self to the bitter sorrows of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

But if it be so glorious, 'tis as difficult: I can do all things through him who strengthens
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42872:103"/> me, and can do nothing of my self. O give me then the grace that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to accomplish what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandest, and after that, command me what thou will'st. Thou madest thy self like to me, in taking my Flesh. O make me like to thee by giving me thy Spirit; I am thy Image, O God, but a defac'd corrupted Image, and on which the Devil hath spread his infamous Marks. O cleanse thou me again; pass with the Pencil of thy Grace over the defaced lines of this thy Image: Wash away all the impurities the World hath scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and left there: If I cannot follow thee, draw me, that I may run after thee: Give me the wings of thy Love that I may fly after thee: Give me, O my Lord, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to imitate and follow thee, for sure I should if I desir'd it: I will, I will, my God, but 'tis not with a free triumphant Will, but with a slavish one. Give me, O Lord, both to will and to do. My flesh findeth the paths thou trodest in both sharp and difficult, and is discourag'd at the sight of them. How cowardly and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42872:104"/> how unjust is this wretched Body! What if thou hadst indispensably commanded us to walk in the ways of thy forerunner <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist:</hi> to dwell in the Wilderness: to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit some poor Cave at the foot of a Mountain; or the Trunk and shade of some old Oak; to be clothed with Haircloth, to feed ordinarily on Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs, and to make a Feast on some wild Hony? If thou leddest not this life thy self; it was to spare us, and not set before us a life very hardly imitable. These are but the outsides of Piety, which may be oftentimes Cloaks for Hypocrisie; but thou hast set us great Examples, real, solid, and internal Vertues. If thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandest us not, to wear Haircloth, thou wouldst we should be clothed with Righteousness and Holiness, with bowels of Compassion and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Spirit. If thou sendst us not into the Desarts, thou wouldst we should retire into the secrets of our Hearts, there to converse with thee, and hear the truths thou wouldst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal unto us. If thou obligest us not, to feed on Locusts, thou wouldst
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42872:104"/> at least, that we should feed upon the bread of Tears, and mix our drink with those salt bitter streams. Thou wouldst that I should make my Feasts near to the Fountain of <hi>Sichar,</hi> at <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well full of deep Mysteries, and full of living Waters, full of Ioy and Consolation: that I should seek for my Delights in thee my Saviour, that art that Fountain <hi>springing up to everlasting life:</hi> Thou wouldst that I should feed upon thy Love, and find no Ioys but in thee: O do it then my Saviour, take from me all relish of the pleasures of this World; and let my Heart be entirely possessed by thee: and let me tast that Pleasure that fills the capacity of my Soul in such a measure, that when it feels those Sweets, it may cry out, <hi>My Soul is satisfied as it were with marrow and fatness.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> What Innocent Pleasures are, that Devotion is not Chagrine, nor an Enemy to Pleasures.</head>
                  <p>I Have proved in the foregoing Chapters, that the Spirit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is an Enemy to Sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and not only to those that are called Criminal, but to those also that are reputed Innocent. In this Rank I have placed those continual Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to which the greater number and the better sort give themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 'Tis time to explain our selves upon this Question, Whether it be necessary to the being a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and truly Devout, to renounce all sort of Pleasures: but 'tis not to be answer'd in a word, because 'tis one of the most nice and delicate Points of Christian Morality.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42872:105"/>
                  <p>I say then, first of all, that Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not an Enemy of Delights. It permits us to distinguish Innocent from Criminal ones: 'tis neither fierce nor brutal, but should be Honest, Civil, Sweet and Modest: it flies all softness, and decks not it self in Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but neither does it affect to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear horrid, or beset with Thorns and Prickles; In a word, it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Faithful, that to be truly devout, he should feed on Troubles, Discontents, and black Melancholy. On the other side, Piety is gay and free, <hi>the Heart of the just is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Feast;</hi> Our Lord would not have us affect a sad Countenance, and a dejected Look, but bids us even in our Fastings and Mortifications, <hi>anoint our heads with Oil, when we would be seen of men, and avoid Ostentation in our Devotions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To know which Pleasures are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, we must distinguish with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, and make a short review, but general, of all the Orders and Degrees of Pleasure.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42872:106"/>
                  <p>First then, all Pleasures are either of the Mind, or Sense. Of the Senses some are more visibly fastned to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, others less. Of the first kind are the Tast and Touch; of the second, are the Sight and Hearing. The more spiritual Pleasures are, the easier 'tis to make them Innocent; the more material, the commoner they are to us with Beasts, and more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come brutal and criminal. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Touch and Tast, are such, and are common to us with the Beasts. To look upon them in themselves; they are unworthy of a Man, as he is Man, and let them exceed never so little, they become in a manner bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: But however, 'tis certain that these pleasures, because they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, are in some degrees inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. There are pleasures insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from those Actions that are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the conservation of Life; such as are eating, drinking, and sleeping. These pleasures cannot be Enemies ro Vertue and Devotion. God is the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42872:106"/> Author of them: He hath put cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Agreements betwixt our Senses and their Objects: he hath annexed certain pleasures to certain Actions, to the end we should love to do them, and take pains without Vexation, in what is necessary to our preservation. We cannot hinder our selves from judging that Sugar is sweet, and Gall bitter, to find pleasure in good Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and a kind of trouble in eating a thing whose tast we don't like. 'Tis impossible not to feel a great deal of pleasure in Drinking after a long and grievous Thirst: This is not what I call the Use of the pleasures of this World, for the Use I mean is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and this is not so. Now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Morality, as severe as it is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accuse involuntary Sentiments of a Fault. We cannot separate this sense of Pleasure from the Actions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Life; and though we could, we should not be oblig'd to do it. The Moral of Christianity command us not to mix our Meats with Gall, nor
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42872:107"/> our Drinks with Wormwood. If there are any such Devout ones in the World, that make their Vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the privation of these necessary Pleasures, and say, <hi>Give me the grace, O God, to feel no pleasure in the use of the things of this World,</hi> they are either Hypocrites, or intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with vain Superstition. But let us take good heed, this is a slippery place and dangerous step; the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that bound and separate Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from Faultiness are so delicate, that they are almost imperceptible, and we pass from one to the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it. The point of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is that which divides the <hi>Necessary</hi> from the <hi>Superfluous.</hi> 'Tis innocent to find pleasure in Eating, 'tis faulty to eat to find pleasure. We must take our Food as we take our Physick, for necessity only, and this cannot possibly be faulty, although we should find pleasures in the way. But farther, we cannot pass without some danger, there can nothing be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42872:107"/> better thought on, than what S. <hi>Austin</hi> said on this occasion. <hi>Then, when I pass from the incommodity of hunger to the refreshment I find by eating, my Concupiscence lays Snares in the way; for 'tis accompanied with Pleasure, and there is no other way to come to that Refreshment which Necessity forces us to seek; and though the support of life be the only thing that obliges us to eat and drink, the dangerous Pleasure crosses us in the passage, and looks at first like a Servant, but oft-times makes attempts to pass on forwards, and makes me do that for it which I design'd only to do for pure Necessity.</hi> And that which serves to deceive us herein, is, that Necessity has not the same extent that Pleasure has, being commonly satisfied with that which carries no pleasure along with it. Oft times we are uncertain, whether 'tis the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of supporting life, that carries us to eat, or the deluding Charms of pleasure; and our unfortunate Souls are pleased with this uncertainty, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42872:108"/> look about for Excuses to defend themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Hearing and the Sight provide us pleasures more Pure, and less Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; the Brutes know nothing of them, they are only proper to Men: if Beasts find pleasure in the sight of certain Objects, 'tis always by the connexion there is betwixt those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and the pleasures of the Tast and Touch, of which alone they are sensible. But yet 'tis certain, that of these pleasures of the Sight and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there are some exceeding Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: and such are those that have a particular Alliance, with the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Hearts and Minds, and are capable of awakening that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: of this Order, are all lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Pictures and obscene Figures, impure Talk, the Sights on the Stage, humane Beauties charg'd with bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Ornaments; accompanied with Gestures, Words and Actions proper to kindling foul unclean Desires. When we use these Pleasures, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42872:108"/> our Senses; for the use of them is unlawful; but amongst these plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Senses of the Sight and Hearing, there may be found some innocent, and those are they alone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, that come immediatly from Gods hand, without having pass'd through mens. Poor Man is so unhappy as to leave Traces of his Corruption up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every thing he meddles with. One cannot be faulty in looking with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and with admiration on the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Heavens, their Order, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their Light: on fine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, verdant Meadows, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable obscurity of a Forest, and a River that winds along the Hills. One cannot be faulty in finding pleasure, in the murmurs of a gliding Brook; the lovely Musick of the pretty Birds rejoycing in the Woods for the return of Spring. All these Delights disturb not the Soul, nor put it into any disorderly motion, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions they make are sweet and soft, and not being violent, they transport
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42872:109"/> not the Soul beyond its self and due bounds, and therefore they are friends enough to Piety. These pure and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ideas, may excite movements of Admiration of our great Creator, and an acknowledgment of their Author, and consequently may inspire us with Devotion to the Deity.</p>
                  <p>There are other corporal Pleasures, that I cannot well refer to any of the Senses, and therefore I call them the Pleasures of Imagination. And of this kind, is the pleasure of having fine Houses, rich Moveables, magnificent Garbs, a great Train, and abundance of People to eat his Meat. And these Pleasures are not without their Fault; they are pleasures of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and therefore of Illusion, and where there is Illusion, there is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and where there is Vanity, there is some Fault. Therefore the Wise man cries out on every thing, <hi>Vanity of Vanities.</hi> But there is somewhat more than Illusion in the case, there is also Pride. The pleasure that this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42872:109"/> vain Pomp brings, this Luxury and State comes from the desire we have to appear <hi>Great,</hi> and to be so indeed. We easily deceive other men, and we would try to deceive our selves. We are like those Dwarfs, that affect to stand on high places, to diminish their natural Lowness, and therefore people that have least Merit and true Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are commonly fondest of these false Greatnesses and fine Appearances. There are Conditions from which Magnificence is as it were inseparable: God that hath invested Kings with Power, takes it not ill they should be cloath'd in Purple. And 'tis neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary they should be surrounded with Pomp and Lustre, to surprize the Senses, to obtain with more ease the respect that is due to their high Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis an ordinary illusion of the Senses, this, that makes us look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as great, all that dazles us. But 'tis an illusion that in these Cases has its use and benefit. Where the true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Condition and Authority is,

                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:42872:111"/> we may well bear with appearing Greatnesses: but yet there may be a fault in its Excess, as in other things. The Great ones resemble those Giants, that are not content with their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral greatness, but stretch out their hands towards Heaven, that they may be seen the farther off. But above all 'tis a mad pleasure that, when one is little in all respects, to please ones self with appearing Great, and cloathing their contemptible Dust with Purple, that heretofore was proper onely to the Throne. This is a Fault in our Age, and which I believe we exceed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ages in; and the Corruption is now spread so far, that we think our selves oblig'd to follow it; for there are wise and pious Persons, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with great assurance this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Maxim, That one should not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish ones self, but that every one should go cloath'd according to their quality and condition, and affect nothing singular: In a word, they boldly blame those Women, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42872:111"/> profession of great Devotion, are but simply and meanly attir'd, and far from the pomp of Persons of their Rank. 'Tis a strange thing, we should be at such a distance from Devotion, that we should be affraid to come near it, and shun even all appearances thereof. According to this Maxim, 'twould be well, that Christian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should be clad in richer Stuffs and more magnificent, that they should be adorn'd with Gold and Jewels, in all abundance, since people of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are so; if they retrench these Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to do Alms and be merciful to the poor, they are accus'd of being Devotresses. The mischief seems to be without a Remedy, when it has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so much ground as this. The Church thought heretofore that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax'd exceedingly, when it but tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated these Disorders, but I'm afraid 'twill quickly come to give them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. I would fain know of those that maintain this Maxim, where they could possibly find it. It is not
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42872:112"/> in the holy Scriptures; for St. <hi>Peter</hi> expresly forbids the Christian Women, Gold and embroidered Hair. 'Tis not in the Fathers, for they speak with more force when they speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the luxury and pomp of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, than against any thing besides, they call it the Pomp of the Devil. They preach in all places against this Vanity, and say, that by the Laws of Charity one is oblig'd to renounce these Superfluities, to cloath the poor, and comfort the afflicted, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the tottering Church. They would have it, that the plainness of Habits should be a Token of Piety, and of our renouncing of the World.</p>
                  <p>Now for all Love, let them shew us a Reason, why people must not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish themselves. What does it mean? Must we follow the Stream? because an Evil is common, must we not strive against it? Must we not try to get out of the Croud that are going to destruction? For my part on the contrary, I think we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42872:112"/> our selves if we have but the courage to do it. I would fain know if great Modesty be not as good in Garbs as in other things. If it be good, can it be bad to shew an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it? Is it not rather an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to march the forwardest in the way of Vertue? I know that Habits have all along been different accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mens Conditions. But first we must observe, that in our days, there are few or none that carry not their State beyond their Rank. Now it is always Honourable to do what one should, according to the condition one is in, although one should be single and alone. Moreover, heretofore they distinguish'd not Conditions so exactly as they now do; the difference of Conditions must have been exceeding great, to have people permitted to distinguish themselves from others by Magnificence. It was not enough to have been Rich, or of Birth rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Vulgar. But if at this time of day we suffer men to be cloathed,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42872:113"/> and make dependencies according to their Conditions, Pride and Vanity that mark out the bounds of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, will throw men into great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Excesses. It is good further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, to consider, that there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between tolerating a thing as a thing permitted, and authorizing it as a thing necessary. We can beat that the Great ones should be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, by their Equipage and Train, and by their Garbs, provided it run not to that Excess that now adays reigns. But certainly we must never make it a Rule, and a Duty, nor tell them, that they ought not to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish themselves. On the other hand, we must let them know, that 'tis a glorious thing to renounce to these miserable vain things, that are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to God. In a word, this Maxim was never more dangerous, than it is in our days. To expend ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens Conditions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the style of the World, is to expend all ones Estate, in Vanities,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42872:113"/> Cloaths, Ornaments, Equipages, and things of that nature. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any one says to another, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish not your self, but do as the rest of your Condition do; It is certain he authorizes that unhappy profuseness, that incapacitates men from being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to the Church, and poor. Say therefore all that can be said, I shall never think that man truly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Devout, whilst I see him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with the pomps and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this wicked World. One cannot have true Devotion without being truly humble. But now this reason that they give us, that makes men make such profitless Expences, according forsooth to their Conditions, fetches its rise from Pride. The true Christian that considers himself, with respect to himself and God, knows he is nothing but dust and ashes, and a very Nothing before God. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands very well, that God knows all the differences of our Conditions. And thus every good Soul will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42872:114"/> renounce this <hi>excess</hi> of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and all other vain <hi>superfluous</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to do good works.</p>
                  <p>We must not, in a word, persuade our selves, that this Morality which is truly that of Jesus Christ, is a way that leads to Superstition, and that pious Persons are oblig'd to attire themselves in a base and extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vile manner. 'Tis in this respect we must bid them <hi>affect nothing singular.</hi> But there is a wide difference betwixt the Magnificence of the Age, and such Habiting as would make people ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; I could not deny this small Digression, to combat the Corruption of these days, in favour of those good Souls, that earnestly desire to do their Duty, but understand not well to what they are obliged. I now return to the Pleasures of Imagination, of which I had begun to speak.</p>
                  <p>Amongst those I call the Pleasures of Imagination, I find some that are Innocent. For Example, A man may innocently set his Heart upon the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42872:114"/> Culture of a little piece of Ground, and take as much delight in his poor Cottage as in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and in his pretty Garden, as in the Park. He may perfectly make himself happy in dressing up his Borders, his Palisades, his Arbors, his Wall-fruit, and his Dwarf-trees. He may gather his Fruits, with greater acknowledgments of Gods goodness, than Monarchs do, in raising Tribute upon all their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. A Father of a Family may take great pleasure in the ordering of his House, a Woman at her Work, and a Tradesman at the success of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. It may be there is not in all this any real Felicity; they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Imagination, but 'tis not of a foolish Imagination, that is fed with Illusions; 'tis an Imagination guided by Reason, enlightned by Grace, and that judges that one should more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem what one has, than what one has not. These Pleasures and innocent Mistakes, if we may call them so, are by no means Enemies to the Spirit of Devotion.</p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:42872:115"/>
                  <p>There are also Pleasures of the Mind (of another sort than those of the Imagination) which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves innocent, such as, good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, the reading good Books, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Discourses, the study of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and works of Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But there is a great deal of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to be used here; first, there is reason to fear, lest we confound the Wit with its Impurity. Oft-times we believe we find a great deal of Pleasure in a Work, because there is a great deal of Wit, but indeed 'tis only because there is a great deal of Impurity in it: there are certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Wit, that flatter our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, such as are the pieces of the Theatre, Romantic Stories, and what the World calls <hi>Gallantry</hi> in Prose and Verse. We admire the delicacy of Expression, the beauty of the Thought, and the force of the Imagination; but look a little nearer and you shall find the Heart incomparably more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected than the Mind: We love these
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42872:115"/> productions, because they have a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret alliance with the corruption of our Heart, and a conformity with the impressions of our sullied and impure Imagination. The pleasure that rises from them comes from the Impurity that is delicately scattered up and down. There are Objects whose Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is so great, that they create an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in us of them; and when they are shewn to us stark naked, we cannot endure the sight; but we can willingly enough see them by glances as it were, and through a loose Veil, that takes away all that is chocquing, and nauseous to the Eyes, but lets them wholly in upon the Imagination, which entertains them with extreme pleasure and greediness. This is the Character of the Pieces we speak of. But we must take good heed that amongst our innocent Diversions we place not those that arise from Sciences, that are criminal, curious, and visibly vain, of no use and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but to fill the Brains, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42872:116"/> them of all good Things besides. We must also observe that 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted us to relish Pleasure in the studies of good Letters, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and profitable Notions; but we must take good heed that we suffer our selves not to be too far posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with them. For nothing can be Innocent, that becomes an Obstacle to our Devotion.</p>
                  <p>This is sufficient, I think, to shew; that Devotion has not declared War with Pleasures and Delight. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a wise and prudent Choice of Pleasures, one may find enough to sweeten all the bitternesses of this Life, so that it will not be necessary to bury our selves alive, and keep our Soul always in Sorrow, always in Trouble and Perplexity, and dark and melancholy Humour.</p>

                     <p>How much do I owe to thee, O God! what shall I render to thee, for having plac'd me amidst so many good things and leaving me to the enjoyment of them? I should have had no reason to complain, if after so much disobedience, he should have snatch'd me from this World, to throw me into Hell. Or was it not in his power to make this VVorld a kind of Hell to me, that I might be saved in the other? One could not have blamed his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor his Justice, had he submitted me here to continual punishments, had he shut up from me all springs of pleasure and delight; had he turned all my fair days into so many sad and dismal Nights. He might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me Eyes for nothing but to be fill'd with Tears, and Ears to receive no sound but that of Thunder and the voice of his Judgments: a Tast for nothing but the bitterness of Gall and Wormwood; a Touch to be sensible of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the weight of his Blows: he might have mingled all my Feasts with Gall, and empoisoned every Object, and enclosed them, as it were, with Thorns, to pierce me through at coming near them. Had he done this, I should have said, that he is just, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42872:117"/> I a wretched Sinner; it is but reasonable that this World, polluted by my sins, should be the Theatre of my sufferings, and that the Objects of my Senses, over all which my Corruption is spread, should become the punishment of my Offences. But all on the other side, God that commands me to be sober, wise and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, to renounce to the vain pleasures of the VVorld and Flesh, yet has left me pleasures more than I deserve; sufficient to temper and make supportable the sad effects and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of my sin. 'Tis true, sometimes he strikes me, and makes me feel the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Anger: I am subject to Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I may languish and become faint; I may lose the good things he hath given me; I may be despoiled of my Honours, and I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted: But when I reckon up my evil days, and compare them with my good, I find that these are more than those: my pleasures carry it infinitely above my pains. If I put together all my hours of sicknesses, disquiet, and vexations, 'twill make perhaps but a few months, or at most but a few years, but how many years of health and prosperity hath God bestowed on me? O wretched and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that I am; a little pain in my Finger makes me become insensible of the health of my whole Body: an hour of disquiet poisons
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42872:117"/> my whole Life, and makes me forget all my Prosperities, and all the Obligations that I have to God. But should my misfortunes have gone farther, and continued longer, they had not yet been as long as my life, and consequently had been of less continuance than my sins: And therefore I should have had no reason to complain, but rather to boast of his favours and goodness. For if I have been unhappy for some years, yet I have been a Sinner from my first moment. And should the minutes of my sufferings pass in Gods Accounts, and satisfie his justice for as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minutes of my Sin, what wouldst thou owe him yet, my Soul, for all the rest, since the number of thy sufferings comes not near the number of thy sins? The minutes in which God hath suffered me to enjoy his good Gifts, have been those in which I have made my self most faulty by the abuse of my Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And the least sin I have committed in one of those minutes might deserve the pains of infinite Duration.</p>

                     <p>Great God, that makest all things with immense Wisdom, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to blame in all thy works. For all that thou hast made is very good. But I bewail my own mishap, and deplore my corruption. The good dwells in the neighbourhood of Evil, and the things thou permittest me are so near to what thou forbiddest, that if I never so little forget my self, from innocent I pass to criminal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. The Devil lies in Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade in every place, and my concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence throws out its Snares on every hand: The way is strait, and borders still on Precipices. I know my God thou art of infinite goodness, and requirest not of me, that I shold live continually in grief; thou yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est something to the flesh, as great a Rebel as it is against thee. But hard it is, and dangerous, to mark precisely out the bounds that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lawful pleasures from forbidden ones. If I listen to my desires, they will extend them far beyond all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42872:118"/> Reason: they will endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade me, that whatever is agreeable cannot be bad; that whether I eat or drink, or sleep, or wake, hunger, or thirst, be idle, or in labour, I am always under Temptation, and in perpetual fear of falling into Excess. Thy Providence would have me pass through all these Dangers; 'tis thou alone art capable of conducting me securely through so hard and difficult a Way. O let thy Spirit lead me forth into the smooth Way, and suffer me not to turn unto the right, nor to the left. Here are two Extremities to avoid; thou abhorrest carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, but it may be too, thou lovest not excessive Austerities; <hi>bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise profiteth but little, but godliness hath the promises of the present life, and of that which is to come.</hi> I know, my God, there is a great deal of danger in each Extremity. All that thou sayest of bodily Exercise is this, that it is profitable but to few things; but for the other Excess, to wit, of Pleasures, it spoils every thing, it ravages the Conscience, sullies the Heart, ruins the Body, grieves the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42872:119"/> Holy Spirit, and separates the Soul from thee my God. It is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the surest therefore, to renounce to pleasures in general, than to chuse out some particular ones, exposing ones self thereby to the danger of chusing some unlawful ones. O thou that holdest in thy Hand the hearts of Men, as the Rivers of Waters, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thou mine in the surest way, in which I may be certain not to be able to offend thee, and that is, the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all sensual Pleasures. Take from me the relish of these Ioy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Pluck from this Devil of Pleasure, the Masque that covers him, and that false Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that so charms me: That I may see all its Deformities, and fly and have them in abhorrence. Since the Body thou obligest me to carry about me, to nourish and to preserve, obliges me to actions that are join'd with Pleasure, give me the grace to do those actions to satisfie Necessity, and not to serve my pleasures.

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That we should not consult our Heart and Sense in the Choice of Pleasure, and that Devotion leads to true Pleasure.</head>
                  <p>WE believe that to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, one must ask a great deal more than one would have; and that to withdraw men from their Errours, it is good to carry matters a little to the other Extreme: to the end that in returning they may at least continue in a reasonable Mean. This is that, it may be, that hath set so many Christian Authors and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42872:120"/> Preachers on imitating the style of the Stoicks in discoursing on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Pain and Pleasure. These People tell us Pain is no Evil, nor Pleasure any Good, and one may be compleatly happy in <hi>Phalaris</hi> his <hi>Burning-Bull;</hi> and compleatly miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amidst the greatest Pleasures. This Method is not, it may be, so very good as they imagine: it mightily discourages the mind to require of it too much, and one can persuade to nothing, when one cloaths the Truth in Paradoxes, for they but awaken the Curiosity, and make the mind wild and uneasie; and after all, one cannot persuade men contrary to what they feel. <hi>Tully</hi> tells us of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher that was blinded in this matter as far as any of the rest, by the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous reasonings of his Sect, but a great defluxion of Rheum upon his Eyes, which caused him a horrible deal of Pain, prevail'd over the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his Philosophy and made him quit those fond Opinions. When we
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42872:120"/> see one of these wise Men lying on his Bed cruelly tormented with the Gout and Stone, and hear him cry out, <hi>'Tis to no purpose this, O pain, for thou shalt never make me confess thou art an Evil!</hi> One could not help look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this as a Comedy, and a piece of profound Hypocrisie. Reason can do nothing against Experience, and especially a Sense so quick as that of Pain. I can conceive very well how the Martyrs were happy amidst their punishments, because they felt not all their pains. For I believe their Souls, by the help of Gods Grace, were so fully possess'd with the hopes of Glory and the Crown they were near upon receiving, that there was no place left for any other Sentiments. The patience of the faithful in their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings proceeds, in my Opinion, from nothing else but that their Souls are fixt on God and Heaven, the Objects of their hope, and loosened in part from their Body, and less attended to their Evils. Impatience on the other

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:42872:122"/> hand is a motion of the Soul that turns to the Bodies side, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons it self to pain, and feels it every bit. I conclude then that Pain is an Evil, and that is to own that bodily Pleasure is a Good, I think I owed this Confession to those that would oblige us to renounce to sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; to the end, I may have them, by this sincerity, the more attentive to my Reasonings. We sollicit them therefore, not to renounce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Body, as Evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but as an inconsiderable Good, that draws after it an incredible train of Mischiefs, and as a Good unworthy of a man that's born for nobler Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and design'd for the possession of much greater goods. We shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to rid the mind of Man, do what we can, of that Opinion that Felicity consists in Pleasure. I would not dispute this Maxim, the Sovereign Happiness consists undoubtedly in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing of the Sovereign Good, and in this possession the Soul feels its
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42872:122"/> chief Good, and may if it will call it its Sovereign Happiness. But men are mightily cheated in this matter, they persuade themselves that the Soul is only capable of such Pleasures as proceed from the Body. Amongst the common sort, a spiritual Pleasure, and a Chimerical or fanciful Pleasure, is one and the same thing. All such as make their happiness consist in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and in Actions wholly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from those that create us Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleasure, pass in the World for meer Visionaries. This Errour is caused by the Sense and Heart, and therefore I say in the judgment we should make of Pleasures, and the choice of them, we should consult nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Heart nor Sense. I say this Errour is caused by the Sense and by the Heart, because they think nothing is truly pleasant but what seems so to them. We judge things good or evil by the reference they have to our Senses, to which they bring or Pain or Pleasure, therefore the Heart and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42872:123"/> Senses which are bodily cannot be touch'd by things Spiritual: they imagine they cannot be pleasant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot feel that Pleasure. Just as if a blind man should judge according to his Senses; he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly judge there was no such thing as Colour, or if there was, it could make no impression on the Soul. This is an Illusion must be scattered and driven away.</p>
                  <p>First then, we must remember, that Man is made up of two parts, the Soul and Body, and each of these has its distinct Goods, the goods of the Soul are spiritual, those of the Body bodily. Of these two parts, the Soul is infinitely the more Excellent, and properly <hi>the Man,</hi> and the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this Man, and by consequence the goods and pleasures that belong to the Soul by it self, are infinitely greater than the goods that accrew to it, by its conjunction with the Body. In short, it is easie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend why the Heart and Senses
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42872:123"/> judge otherwise, they are bodily Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and 'tis no wonder that they hold for things bodily. As for the Senses, 'tis without dispute that they, their Organs, and their Operations are bodily and always savour of it. 'Tis no less true of the Heart, that it is bodily, and by the Heart I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Seat of the Passions and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination; 'tis evident that both these Faculties are corporeal. The Imagination is, for 'tis the place where those Images that come to us from the Senses meet, and offer themselves to our minds when their true Objects are away: the Passions are also Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, for they are formed and made by motions purely mechanical; and this we see by the Characters they impress on the Body, such as are the motion of the Blood, quick or slow, or precipitated, the paleness or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Hew, the fire or faintness they impress on the Eyes. The Senses therefore and the Heart, which are bodily, being the Gates by which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42872:124"/> enter our Souls, they carry with them none but corporeal Images, and cause in it none but sensual pleasures: and the Soul gets a Habit of believing that there are no other, because it never tries to unloose it self from the Body, or tast any thing besides. But is it possible we should believe our Senses in so important a matter, against our Interest and against our Reason? The Senses are not capable of knowing the thousandth part of what belongs to Bodies. As soon as a Body ceases to have any considerable extension, we cease to see and feel it, and would we make these Senses Judges of things absolutely spiritual? In good truth, the Soul is miserable and Slave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if it cannot tast that pleasure which is its Sovereign happiness, by means of the Body: if Matter be the source of true Pleasure, what shall those Souls do that are separated from Matter? What is the happiness of Angels that have no Body? and yet is it not true that their pleasures should
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42872:124"/> as far transcend ours, as Spirits are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Matter? Spiritual pleasures come undoubtedly from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Truth, from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Vertue, from our Union with God by the bonds of our Love to him, and from that Action by which God does immediately unite himself to our Souls. All this is absolutely above our Senses, they know not the Truth, for their Office is only to bring and carry up and down the Images of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; they cannot judge of Vertue, 'tis not of their Cognisance, and much less can they judge of that mutual Union betwixt God and the Soul. Thus though they give us no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of these Affairs, yet 'tis not to be doubted, but that they make real impressions on our Souls.</p>
                  <p>But whence comes it, say some, that Spiritual pleasures are not so affecting, that they make not such powerful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions on the Soul, as corporeal pleasures do? For we do not see the pious and devout ones in such Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42872:125"/> of joy and pleasure, as we see men have in the enjoyments of their sensual pleasures: and is it not a proof that these pleasures of the Mind are but imaginary ones, or at least but very languid ones? This difficulty comes from hence that we cannot well distinguish the Body from the Soul: we believe it is affected proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the greatness of the Agitation of its bodily Organs: and persuade our selves that it cannot receive an impression of Joy, but by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these great bodily Motions. But 'tis not so, 'tis certain that in those great pleasures which the Soul receives from the Body, it receives them by those Agitations of the Body, and by the rapid motion of the blood and spirits: but the pleasures of the Saints, that are included in the Soul it self, and that shew abroad no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tokens, yet cease not to make very great impressions: They are so great and so affecting, these Joys, that they transport the Soul beyond it self,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42872:125"/> and out of the World. It must needs be that the Joy that comes from our possessing God, from the knowledge of his Truth, the imitation of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and Excellencies, must needs be infinitely above all sensual Joys. Since for their sakes, we do not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all bodily pleasure, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our selves to all the most sensible Torments imaginable. 'Tis true, the more the Soul is accustomed to let it self be mov'd by those Agitations that cause bodily pleasures and passions, the less capable it is of tasting spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and inward Joys. And this is one of the greatest Evils arising from the continual use of bodily pleasures. The Soul waxeth fat and wanton, as the holy Ghost speaks, and lightly regards the Rock of its Salvation. It cloaths it self, as one may say, with flesh and blood, and relishes nothing else but what proceeds from thence, and flatters them. And therefore of all the pleasures of the Sense, we only permit our truly devout Man to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42872:126"/> tast of what is very moderate, and that too, very moderately. The Senses love to receive strong impressions from their Objects, and provided they be not hurt thereby, the greatest bodily pleasures are those, whose motions are so strong, that they come very near to pains. The Imagination also loves to be strongly moved; but all these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are so strong upon the Soul, that it can hardly come to its self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And therefore we must careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid them all.</p>
                  <p>But if we want more sensible proofs, that the Heart, the Passions and Senses should not be consulted in the choice of Pleasures; hearken to Experience, and see the disorders of the World. They are the effects of this blindness of mens Understandings that follow the directions of their Hearts and Senses in their choice of Pleasures. How came our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the forbidden Fruit, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was fair and pleasant to the Sight? She hearkned to her Heart
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42872:126"/> and Senses. How came Corruption to so high a pitch in the World, that it constrained the Justice of God to bring a horrible Flood upon the Earth, but because the Sons of God saw the Daughters of Men, and found them beautiful, and shut their Ears to Gods Voice, that spake unto them? They listned to the sollicitations of their Senses and their Hearts, and took these worldly Beauties and became corrupted with them. How came <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to commit Adultery and Murder in so short a time, but that he listned to his Heart and Senses, and let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be led away by his Passions? How became <hi>Solomon</hi> an Idolater, but by his criminal Affections to his Wives blinding him, and separating him from God, and shutting up the Ears of his Soul and Understanding? In a word, how came St. <hi>Peter</hi> to deny his Master, but that his Heart, his Senses and Imagination, made him see Death present and very terrible, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted neither God nor Reason?</p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:42872:127"/>
                  <p>It may be thought that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Innocent and Guilty when we speak of our Heart and Senses, as the common sources of our Errours; because the Senses seem to be unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and miserable, rather than Criminal: 'Tis true, the Senses are subject to two Misfortunes, the first is, to be forced to take in Objects that are Criminal and capable of carrying Corruption to our Hearts, such as are ill Examples, scandalous Words and Actions; and the second is, that they receive innocent Objects, and sometimes in an innocent manner, but that they are sullied and polluted in the Heart. However, I think, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not separate the Senses from the Heart, for they make but one and the same whole. 'Tis a Match, at whose end there is a heap of Gunpowder and Brimstone fastned: the Heart and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination are the inmost end of the Match, and the Magazine of Powder; the Senses are the other Extremity and End, to which the Objects set fire.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42872:127"/> That glides, or rather flies along the Match, and sets the Heart and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination on a flame, and therefore the holy Ghost puts for the same thing, to walk according <hi>to ones Heart,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <hi>to ones Eye-sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, if we would be perfectly assur'd that the Heart and Senses are bad Counsellors in this Affair; hear what the holy Scriptures say to it. They look upon our Hearts as the sources of all our Evils; <hi>the thoughts of mens hearts are evil continually: It is deep and desperately wicked, who can know it? From the heart proceed evil thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Whoredoms, Thefts, false Witnesses, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Speakings, these are the things that defile the man.</hi> The holy Ghost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Heart, as a blind Man, environ'd with a thick Cloud and great Darkness. It speaks of it as of a dead thing, it is earthly, sensual. How can a Heart thus made, be Judge of what are true Pleasures and truly good things? How can any good
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42872:128"/> thing proceed from so empoisoned a Spring? so the Wise man puts this Maxim amongst the rest that we should hate—<hi>Walk in the ways of thy Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would end here, if it were not necessary, to remove a Scandal, that some may take at what has been said, that sensual Pleasure is a Good, and good too for the Soul: for if the Soul be the only thing that feels and relishes Pleasure, and that Pleasure is a good, 'tis the good of the Soul: if it is a good, then we must seek for it, and love it. You will say; 'tis not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to answer, that 'tis a good of the Body only; that is not true absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaking; 'tis in some sort a good of the Soul, since 'tis the Soul that relishes it: Farthermore, although it were only a good of the Body, yet would it not therefore be unlawful, for 'tis not always forbid us to seek the good of the Body; but we must not only consider a thing in it self, to know whether it be good or evil,,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42872:128"/> but look upon it in its Causes, and Effects, in that which goes before, and that which follows. I would have the pleasure that comes to the Soul by the Body, let it be a kind of good, considered in it self. Look on it in its Source, and see what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces. The source is Sin, and 'tis Impurity, 'tis Rebellion against the Laws of the Creator. That which it brings forth, is the disuniting the Soul from God; 'tis an engagement with Death, 'tis pain and fire, and everlasting horror. How then can we conceive under the notion of Good, a thing that is encompass'd with so many moral Impurities, and so many real Miseries? If bodily pleasure may be called a Good, with respect to the present sentiment of the Soul, 'tis an Evil in every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respect, and an Evil abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely speaking, and therefore Wise Men of all Ages have placed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the false Goods, for what is truly and in it self good, must be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42872:129"/> good, whatever side you look upon it from. The Soul hath then no true pleasure but what arises from its Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God: and this Union is so much the stronger, by how much the looser we sit from things sensible, and closer to God, by the knowledge of the Truth; not of those truths Philosophy teaches us to find, but never find with any certainty; but of those heavenly Truths that Faith discovers to us, those saving Truths that are the Lamps and Lanthorns of the Soul. <hi>Thy Word is a Lanthorn to my feet, and light unto my paths: it enlightens the Eyes, and giveth understanding to the simple.</hi> The second Bond that unites us to God, is Vertue, whose practice makes us like our Creator, renews his Image in us, and makes us to be the Copies of that Beauty, of which he is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal. The third Bond, is Love, that Love by which we love God, and by which he loves us, by which he is in Us, and we in Him, because this Love makes a transfusion as it were
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42872:129"/> of Hearts, and makes the Soul dwell more in the beloved Object, than in that it animates. As to that pleasure that springs from this Union, it is of the number of those things that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be conceived but by such as feel it. It is such, that all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the World seem dead and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing in comparison of it, to those who have once tasted it. So great, that it hath made the Saints that have been extraordinarily affected with it, to fall into holy Extasies and Ravishments, that seemed to have entirely broken the bonds that ty the Body to the Soul. Now 'tis unquestionable that Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leadeth to these Joys: it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes the Union betwixt it and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Things: it unfastens us from the Body: it raises us to God: it purifies our Souls by bringing them nearer to him: it communicates to them the Rays of that great Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and makes them like so many little Gods, by partaking the Glory of the great one.</p>

                     <p>I am not astonished, O my Soul, to see thee seek for Pleasure; thou seekest thy good and that which thou hast lost, that which was given thee, that which thou hast had, and that which thou shouldst yet have had, hadst thou remain'd but innocent. Thy God had made thee just and holy, this Holiness was that which united thee to him; thou wast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from him when thou becamest sinful, and by this separation thou remainest deprived of Pleasure and Felicity: thou seekest in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing the good that thou hast lost; but, blind as thou art, thou mistakest Shadows for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; thou leapest over several things, and if thou findest any thing that flatters and tickles thee, thou presently embracest it with as much Ardor, as if thou hadst found what thou hadst lost, and wast looking for. Thou art indeed disabused of thy mistake in a little time, but 'tis only to fall into another: after thou once hast tasted sensual Pleasure, thou acknowledgest it is not that infinite Pleasure thou wast seeking for: thou leavest that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject then, and seekest for another; that thou embracest too, and feedest thy self continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with new Illusions. Cease, O my heart,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42872:130"/> cease then to wander, and peruse these Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes; be not thus cheated by thy Senses and Imagination. Embrace thy God, 'tis he alone to whom thou owest that general Inclination, that makes thee love Felicity and Pleasure; but thy blind eyes make thee love false goods, and fix thee to false joys and pleasures. If thou wert not exceedingly blind, thou couldst not doubt but God is infinite, and infinitely good, and infinitely better than all things in the world besides, and all Delights together. If created things are so sweet, how pleasant must an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created good be? The good that is the Author of all other goods, that includes in itself the Pleasure of all the rest? The good that spreads abroad in our Hearts, Delights that are as far above all other Joys, as he himself is above all other beings? Thou art incredulous, my Heart, of this, because thou hast not felt the Sweets that spring from being united with God; thou sayest as <hi>Thomas</hi> said, I will not believe unless I see, unless I feel these Joys. Ah! blessed is the man that hath believed before he saw, and hath surmounted all Temptations of the Flesh, and hath desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to tast all Temptations, before he tasted them. But happy more incomparably is he, that hath believed, and seen, and tasted those Delights, and felt those Joys that pass all
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42872:131"/> understanding, that flow from the inmost Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of my God! If thou hast not as yet, my Soul, been able to relish any spiritual Delight, it is because thy God hath not been able yet to apply himself immediatly to thee, and that by reason of thy great Impurities, with which thou art over-run. For his eyes are pure, and cannot behold any thing unclean: he is Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Light itself, and thou art surrounded with the dark Clouds of Ignorance and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: how then should God unite himself with thee? Take therefore, take away the Veil, the Partition-wall, cure thy Ignorance, seek to know God and all his Mysteries, purifie and cleanse thy self, remove that filth and dirt that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thee, deliver thy self from those accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed habits of Vice that come about thee like a Cloak, and God will clothe thee again as it were with Light. Then thou wilt feel, that the Application of sensible Objects to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties is not capable of causing in thee a sense of any such Delights as thou mayest have from God: then thou wilt be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disgusted at these vain Pleasures; thou wilt long to see thy God, to know him, to embrace him, to mix thy self with him, and be confounded as it were, that thou mayest be immediately united with him.</p>

                     <p>O Glorious Father of all Light, O inexhaustible Source of Ioy and Pleasure; insinuate thy self into all the Faculties of my Soul, fill thou the space of my desires, and vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my large heart, and let me feel those Ioys that thou communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catest to thy Saints and Favourites. I discover to thee my Want, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to thee my Nothingness, and languish after thee my true and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Good. Without thee, O my God, I should be the miserablest of all thy Creatures; I should be lost in an Abyss of pain and misery and feel continual anguish and horror. But Oh, thou refreshest me in this vale of Tears, thou feedest me with the Bread of Angels, and givest drink as out of Rivers of Delights. The World understands not these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, the delicacies of thy heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table are to it insipid; it can tast nothing but the Garlicks and Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and knows not what is the Hony of the Land of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42872:132"/>
                        <hi>Canaan.</hi> I know it very well, but know it not as I would and should understand it. I have learnt of thy Saints that when thou speakest to thy Children after their own hearts, the Sentiment that rises thereupon is sweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-comb; and they find more Pleasure in possessing thee, than the most covetous find in their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gold and Silver. But alass, my Soul as yet hath never felt those heavenly Transports! I begin to find and to acknowledge that the Pleasures of this World are incapable of Satisfying that hunger and thirst after Felicity and Pleasure, which I am labouring for, but have not perfectly attained, O my God, thou who art only capable of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling both. <hi>O tast and see how good and gracious the Lord is:</hi> I tast thee, as I see thee; I see thee imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as in a Glass, and I tast thee as somewhat hidden and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up: not that thou art so invelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, for thou art wholly pure and simple, and whoever is pure may tast thee purely, but the Veil is in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42872:132"/> my flesh, or rather 'tis my flesh it self; 'tis my Corruption separates me from thee. Come then, Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, come; Come, Spirit Creator, and Creator of Spirits: <hi>Create in me a new Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> O let my Soul be filled with thy delights, and let me taste the sweetness of thy Love. I am thirsty after Pleasures, open the Springs of thy eternal ones, and make those Rivers to flow into my Soul. <hi>Kiss me with the kisses of thy mouth, for thy Love is sweeter than Wine: tell me, O thou, whom my Soul loveth, where thou feedest at noon-day, why should I be as one that wandreth amongst the Roes of thy Companions?</hi> Why should my Soul wander amongst the vain Pleasures of the World, and why should it give thee so many false Goods for Companions? O let me retire under thy Shadow, let me em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee, worship thee, and love thee only, and tast no Ioys but in thee. O draw me then that I may run after thee: draw near to me that I may draw near to thee: prevent me by thy Grace, thy Mercies, and thy
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42872:133"/> Bowels of Compassion yearning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wandring Son that is in quest of thee, and cannot find thee. <hi>Awake, O North-wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the Spices may flow out, let my Beloved come into his Garden and eat his pleasant Fruits.</hi> Blessed Spirit; thou South-wind, Father of Heat, Author of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Source of Love and Charity, breath over all the faculties of my Soul that are as it were a Desart; make thou an <hi>Eden</hi> of it, a Garden of the Lord God; cause thou to grow up there sweet savouring Plants; bring forth there Habits, and works of good Odour and Scent, that my divine Saviour, the well-beloved of my Soul, may come and tast the sweetness of those Fruits: that he may take in me his pleasure, and I in him may take mine, that we may tast Eternally, all the Delights and Pleasures mutual Love can give.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> That Young Folks have no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to use the Pleasures of the Senses, or to dispense with their Duty of Devotion.</head>
                  <p>THERE is one Reflexion we must needs make, before we leave this weighty Subject: We have not as yet done any thing in respect to young Folks, who it may be may think that what we have hitherto said concerns not them. It is in a manner impossible to deliver them from this Mistake, that Pleasure is their Lot and Inheritance, from which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without a kind of Tyranny, be driven away. Indevotion is natural to them, and they seem to glory in it: I should have fine to do, say they, to play the Bigot at my Age. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade themselves that Modesty, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Sobriety, and Temperance do
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42872:134"/> not sit handsomly on them: 'Tis the Business, say they, of old People, we should make our selves ridiculous, to play the <hi>Seneca</hi>'s and <hi>Cato</hi>'s and such wise Folks: And indeed, if any of them have better Inclinations than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, they are asham'd of it, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, and follow the Crowd. There is a time, they say, for every Business under the Sun: If we consider old and young people, one can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that such different persons can be destin'd to the same Actions: The wrinkled forehead of Age, the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Hew, the hollow Eyes, the fallen in Mouth, and trembling Limbs, have some agreement with the actions of Repentance, it is but reasonable that they should shed forth Tears, and give themselves to Mortification: but the brave hail Conplexion of Youth and good Case, that Flower of of Blood, that spreads it self over the Hue, the lively sparkling Eyes, the Senses sharp, and easily mov'd, each by their Objects, let us plainly see, this
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42872:134"/> Age was made for Pleasure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And thus it is, they flatter, and thus lull themselves: and 'tis not young ones only talk at this gay Rate, but most of the World consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. I will not deny but that such Excesses and disorders of Life, leave upon Age a deeper mark of Shame and Infamy, than Youths Debauches do on them: nay, I will own that they discover a greater mass and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Corruption, in the one than t'other, Age cannot throw its faults upon the boylings and first sallies of its Blood, that throws up its froth and scum; it cannot have for its excuse the want of Experience. And in a word, it must break through stronger bonds and holds of Shame, than the sins of Youth. But yet, God will not judge men, according to humane Rules, and the Sentiments of the World, in these Cases; there is no Age that is dispensed with, by him, from paying him Obedience. All Violaters of his Laws shall be punished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42872:135"/> his Commands were given to all; and though the difference of Age, may make a difference of Faults in respect of the punishment, yet this will only make, that some are more and some less; but alas, the less mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable shall have sufficient reason to bewail their Case, for the least miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able shall have for their Inheritance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Flames, and a Worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies. But why should Young ones be less oblig'd to Devotion? Hath God given less unto them? nay sure, they have receiv'd of God, as well as their Elders, their Being and their Reason, but withal they have more vigour of Body, more strength of Mind, Health, Youth, and the Flower of Age. These certainly are more particular Obligations on them to the serving of God. They have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all these Advantages, to devote them unto the God of Pleasure and Concupiscence. Is it too good for God? Alas, they appoint to him a Body worn out, corrupted Lungs,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42872:135"/> Eyes quite extinguish'd and dry and useless Members. In truth God will be much obliged to them: they will give him the dregs of their Age, and consecrate to him that time, that is the Sink of Life, and Centre of all Miseries: that is to say, they will give him that, which the World cares for no longer: they will do as Wretches do, bestow their Liberalities when they are dying: and give what they can keep no longer. Believe me, all and the best we have is not too good for God. He would not heretofore have any Victims, that had any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, or were sick and languishing, or had lost a Limb. Do we think he will accept the Offering of a Heart worn out, and of a Man that is but the shadow of what he once was? I exhort you to present your Bodies a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sacrifice. But those young Folks who make a resolution to be Devout, when they can sin no longer, promise to God dead and corrupted Carcasses. For so the Bodies of old Men are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42872:136"/> to be call'd. God hath thought nothing too good for us, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for us, and to us; he who is the Sovereign Good, he gave us his Son, and devoted him to death for us in the Flower of his Age; and 'tis but just that we in every Age should be devoted to his Service.</p>
                  <p>God is not satisfied with promises of Things to come, or <hi>I will give:</hi> he would have us speak in present terms, and say, <hi>I give;</hi> for so he speaks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>I give you my peace,</hi> he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he that <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is to come;</hi> to him belong the Differences of Time, past, present, and to come: but of all Times he loves the present, and is he that <hi>is.</hi> Now he that would be like to God, and please him, must speak as he speaks; I <hi>am</hi> he that <hi>is</hi> just, holy, separated from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, devoted to God, and to his Service.</p>
                  <p>God heretofore required the first Fruits, and the firstlings of the Flock, and the First-born of Children; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:42872:136"/> rose early in the Morning to go and sacrifice his Son: and God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a never-dying Fire to be kept in his Temple, for the continual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Morning as well as the Evening one. This signifies that God would be served first, and that our earliest Steps should be consecrated to him; he would not have us say, <hi>Come and follow me, if the World leaves any thing behind, that thou, O God, shalt have.</hi> He can't endure those Folks that have the insolence to say, <hi>Suffer me first to go and bury,</hi> &amp;c. He answers them, <hi>Go, let the dead bury their dead, come thou and follow me. For he that lays his hands upon the Plow, and then looks back, is not fit for the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are no people in the World of any Age, that do not in good earnest own, that it is necessary, once in ones Life, to think upon God; and the Dispute is only about <hi>the Time,</hi> and not <hi>the Thing.</hi> Some say, I will become a good Christian, when I
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42872:137"/> have built my House; and others, when I have made my Fortune; and the younger, when I am old, and have tasted all the pleasures of this Life. All, in a word, remit this matter to the time to come. Now since 'tis owned by all, that 'tis of absolute necessity to give up ones self to God, and that without doing so, Hell and eternal Death are unavoidable, is it not the most extravagant madness in the World, to remit an Affair of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the time to come, for which no mortal Man can answer? O Youth, thou Idolizer of Delights, wilt thou not avail thy self of the Example of that wretched Rich man in the Gospel, that said overnight to his Soul, Eat, drink, my Soul, and make good Chear, for thou hast many goods laid up for many years; and yet that very Night, his Soul that was so ill advised, was called for? Who hath assured you, that you shall come to old Age? Or have you been treating with God, that, whenever Death shall
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42872:137"/> surprise you, he shall receive you to himself? If Death should meet you, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with sins, just coming from the Play or Ball, the Tavern and Debauch, or from a worser place, do you think you shall have right to say at Heaven-gates, Lord, Lord open to us? No, he will answer you, Be gone, I know not who you are, ye workers of Iniquity. Then you will doubtless say, We have sinned against Heaven and before thee, and are not worthy to be call'd thy Sons, but pardon us, and impute all our Offences to our Youth. This will not do, God will not, in favour of Youth, make void that unalterable Decree, <hi>Nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean shall enter into my holy City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jewish Doctors, who do not often say good things, are used to say, <hi>Remember thy God, and turn to him but one day before thou diest.</hi> This is well said: think then on God to day, for, it may be, thou shalt die to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. What is it that we do, for Gods sake, when we dispose of time to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42872:138"/> come, and say, To morrow we will find out such and such Sports, and the Week following, we'll debauch; and we will live at this rate, 'till we are about fifty or sixty, and then we'll think of retiring, and giving the rest to God? We imitate those ambitious, Visionary Princes, that, in hopes of Conquering, do already share out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and bestow great Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they give what is none of theirs. To whom belongs the Time to come? To God undoubtedly, who keeps it, as it were in Cisterns, and lets it run out as seems good to him, and stops, or continues its course as he pleases. And thus when we distribute Time to come, we give away Gods goods; at least we give and design to several Uses, that which as yet is none of ours, and it may be, never will. And this according to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims and wisdom of the World, is the greatest folly that can well be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: 'tis by an old Proverb call'd <hi>sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Lions and Bears Skin, before you have caught them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:42872:138"/>
                  <p>But since 'tis absolutely necessary to devote ones self to God, should we not do it, when 'tis easiest so to do? And I maintain, 'tis easier to love God and turn to him in ones Youth, than 'tis in old Age. This seems to be a Paradox, because in Youth the blood is boiling, the flesh vigorous, and Sin sticks to our Hearts and Entrails, and one takes most delight in the Pleasures of the World. 'Tis true indeed, when once the Reins are let loose to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence in Youth, 'tis almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to stop its Sallies and its Transports: we must drain its Forces, before we put an end to its Disorders. But when it has the happiness to turn to God and Goodness, 'tis sure that it succeeds incomparably better there, than in old Age. Wherever Youth are carried, they are commonly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with Violence and great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. 'Tis the Temperament of their Age. And if they can but guide these first kindlings, it will come to an excellent Zeal, and holy fervour
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42872:139"/> of Devotion: as they, who know how to manage the Rapidity and force of Streams and Rivers dexterously, can make them turn great Mills, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines for the use and benefit of mans Life. But on the contrary, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reaches us, that Devotion cools with Age, and that old People have a great deal to do, to heat and stir their Hearts, in the Exercises of Devotion: their Souls are hardned as it were, and no more touched or moved with so much ease as formerly, because they are not tender as they were, and the fire of Zeal seems to diminish with their natural Heat.</p>
                  <p>Whence come these difficulties in the work of mens Conversions? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is not one but encreases with Age. This difficulty of thinking on God and Goodness comes certainly from a Custom and a Habit. Now Custom in time becomes a Tyrant. It comes from the Devil, and when it hath once establish'd its Tyranny by long possession, it is in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42872:139"/> to root it out. It comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone at first, but in a little time it is called Legion. And that Devil which one might have driven away with a— <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> can now be neither cast out, by Prayer or Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the difficulty comes from hence, that the Faculties are worn out, and the Soul hath lost its strength, and is capable no more of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such a vigorous Enterprise, as that of returning to God, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Sin. In a word, it comes from hence, that God is weary of calling, and inviting, and offering his Grace and Mercy. 'Tis all past, his Patience is changed into a just Fury, which hath been so long abused.</p>
                  <p>But above all, let us consider, how powerful Habits of Debauchery and Luxury grow, when we permit them to take rooting, and grow up to old Age. That young Plant, which with one Finger might have been pull'd up, becomes a Trunk of mighty thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and strong enough to withstand
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42872:140"/> both Sword and Hatchet. This little Monster, the love of Pleasure, that one might easily strangle when 'tis born, becomes so great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in time, that one dare not so much as attack or touch it. But sins become not barely stronger by Age, but their number also increases. They are like Snowballs that gain by every roll. They are Streams that swell and grow bigger, the farther they are from their Springs and Head, it had been easie at first to pass them on foot, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 'tis hard to swim them over. Now the number of sins increasing, increases also the difficulty of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conversion. We read in the Lives of the holy Fathers, that an Angel one day let an Hermit see, in Vision, a certain old Man cutting down Wood in a Forest, to make his burthen up, and carry it away, but the Bundle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceeding great, he found it was too heavy to lift up and lay upon his Back, and therefore throwing it on
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42872:140"/> the ground, he fell again to cutting new Boughs, and joined them to his others, after which he tried again to lift it up, but found it much more heavy than before. But still he let it down, and fell to cutting Boughs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, and did this several times. The solitary Hermit wondring at the folly of the old Man, the Angel took him up, and said,—Mark well that Old Man, he is the Emblem of the men of this World, that heap up sins on sins; then comes a Resolution to be good, and serve God, and some At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts they make towards it; but they quickly sink beneath the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their sins; then they begin again to commit new Faults, as though the burthen by increasing would grow lighter: and when they have carried their Disorders on a great way fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then comes a fresh desire of Devoting their selves to God, but the burthen of their sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes much greater, and their raising their Souls up consequently much
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42872:141"/> more difficult. This Story was made for us; and against those wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men that consecrate their Youth to the pleasures of this World, and remit the practice of Devotion and the raising up their Souls to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to <hi>another time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Austin</hi> explaining the Story of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Resurrection, asks why our Saviour used Sighs and Tears, and Prayers, and loud Cries to raise him up, which he had not used, in raising up other dead Men? Why 'twas, says he, because he had been dead four days. Our Lord would hereby give us an Idea of the Difficulty that is found in the Conversion of a Sinner, when he is setled and confirmed in his sins. The first day, saith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the day of Pleasure, when we relish Sin. The second that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; the third of Love and being fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Delights of Sin; and the fourth is that of Custom and Habit. When once the Man is there, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be converted, but by Cries and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42872:141"/> Tears, and the Voice of our Lord that worketh Wonders. This lets us see, methinks, the Interest we have, and the Necessity of thinking upon God betimes, and consecrating our first Years to Vertue and Devotion. I know very well that the End ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Crown; but I know besides that 'tis of mighty importance to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin well, to the ending well. An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that flies wide at first, when it goes out from the Bow, will be found at a mighty distance, before all its force is at an end, from the designed Mark. A Man who, in his Youth plunges himself into Debauchery, and gives himself wholly up to sensual Pleasures, will find himself, at a mighty distance from God, in his old Age, and will have much to do, to bring himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right Way. And therefore I conclude with the Wise man, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</hi>

                     <head>MEDITATION.</head>
                     <p>Why dost thou, O my Soul, defer, after such Considerations as these? Dost thou not find the necessity of consecrating thy self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay to the service of thy God? Thou criest continually, to morrow, to morrow, but that to morrow never comes, and the day of thy separation from thy Body, will come when least thou lookest for it. VVhen God calls, thou sayst unto him, as the Sluggard says, presently, presently, let me alone a while, a little while, but this presently never comes, and this little while endures continually, as saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> I see very well, that 'tis grievous to thee to be obliged to give thy self thus early unto God. 'Tis too soon, thou sayst, to begin, and would it not be time enough some years hence? Ah wretched and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Soul, canst thou too soon think on thy God? Thou canst not think on him so soon, as he hath thought on thee: Sure 'tis but just, that thou shouldst think on him, as soon as thou beginnest to know thy self, since he hath thought on thee and thy Salvation, from all Eternity. His Essence never had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no nor his Love to thee; they both of them have been from Everlasting. VVhat
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42872:142"/> hadst thou done to oblige him to love thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time was? He loved thee before thou wert, and before thou wast Amiable. He saw thee in thy Nothing, and in the Abyss of thy Corruption, and hath from all Eternity prepared means to pluck thee out of it. He hath designed thee for Glory, and prepar'd thee a Saviour and Redeemer. He hath not then reserved to himself a moment in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he hath not bestowed on thee, and thou wouldst cut off from him, a great many years of that uncertain short life, of which thou hast the use but whilst he pleases. It may be, thou wilt say, that 'twere not unjust thy time should be divided betwixt God and thee, but sure 'tis very hard to give it all away without reserving any thing to ones self; But thou considerest not, 'tis God that gives thee every thing. The Heavens, and Earth, the Fields, the Rivers, Floods, Plants, Trees, and Fruits, and hath kept nothing to himself. Has he not given thee all himself, his only Son, and that to suffer Death for thee? Wouldst thou not therefore be ingrateful, O my Heart, if thou shouldst think to divide with God, and take from him, any thing thou hast? But Ah, my Soul, when thòu thinkest, and talkest at this rate, thou understandest but ill thy Interest. Thou presupposest that thou losest
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42872:143"/> from thy self, whatever time thou givest to thy God; and only savest the hours thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votest to thy self; all the rest is thrown away, and lost in the vast Abyss of Time past. But the Moments thou bestowest on God, are laid up in store, and thou shalt find them safe, they will appear before thee, and be put in the great Account, at the day of Judgment, and thou shalt receive for them an Eternity of Glory. Stick then no longer, defer no more, my Soul, the renouncing to all Pleasures, and all hopes of this VVorld, to follow after God. There is in him the source and Spring of Life, and in his light thou shalt see light, and be fill'd with the good things of his House, and drink as out of a River of Delights. Then, in thy Age, thou never wilt regret the loss of thy Youth; thy days will not be brought to rise in Judgment up against thee, to condemn thee, when thou beginnest to grow down and near the Grave. The thinking on thy God will cause no terrour in thee, thou wilt not look upon him as a Judge, that will come and demand an Account of so many years consum'd in vain Pleasures, but as a great Deliverer that comes to break thy Chains, and as a Rewarder, that comes to bring thee days of Refreshment, for all the sorrowful and painful years that thou hast passed in this World.</p>

                     <p>O God, Conductor of my Youth, light of the Blind, teacher of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, enlightner of the dark and simple, that bringest back the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers into the true Way, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest Praises from the mouths of Babes and Sucklings; teach me thy Ways, and draw me from the ways of this World. Hast thee, O God, that I may hasten towards thee, and leave me no longer in the World and Sin. My Lord, and my God, infuse thy Grace into my Soul, that my Heart may desire thee, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring it may seek after thee, that seeking it may find thee, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may love thee, and in that Love may find its Sovereign Ioy and Happiness.

Come then
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42872:144"/> my God, and snatch me from the Arms of Pleasure, suffer no longer my delays, and when I say to thee, Yet a little while, O wait a little longer; then draw me by thy power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word, and say, <hi>Awaken thou that sleepest, and raise thee from the dead, and Jesus Christ shall give thee light.</hi> If words are not strong and loud enough to raise me, touch thou the Biere, strike on the Body, in which my Soul is buried: 'tis its Cradle or its Tomb, there it sleeps, or there 'tis dead; sensual Pleasures either stupifie or kill it quite: strike on this Body then that its Soul may awake, for <hi>it is better that I enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life with one Eye, than having two, be cast into Hell-fire.</hi> 'Tis better that my flesh should suffer here below some pains, and that my Soul should tast hereafter those endless Ioys thou hast prepar'd for it above.

Shew me the Way unto thy holy Hill, that I may save my self, and that being out of danger, I may look back and see those deluges of Corruption that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow the Country, and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of thy Vengeance that lay the World in Ruins. Alas, my God, had it but pleased thee to have let me tast the spiritual Delights of thy Love, I should not be so sensible to the pleasures of this World, and should not stay so long from seeking thee; for I desire most earnestly and truly to be happy. If then I had but understood my Felicity to have been in thee, I should have flown unto thee to have sought it. O Lord, since Pleasure is the only Loadstone to attract my Soul, make me to tast a little of that Ioy, that I should
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42872:145"/> find in thee, and let me feel thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodness in my Heart, that I may run without delay after thee, and pant with the desires and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Hart, after the living Brooks, to quench the violent Thirst with which I burn.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The first general Advice, to Will, Desire, and Ask it.</head>
                  <p>WE have seen from how many Sources Indevotion rises; let us now try to vanquish these Difficulties by such Counsels that may lead us to Devotion: Those that I will give hereupon are either General or Particular. But before I pass any farther, I must presuppose that he whom I would carry to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, must be very willing himself to go. He that is not so disposed,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42872:146"/> may e'en stop where he is, for 'twill be to no purpose to pass any farther. How many indevout Ones have we in the World that desire not Devotion for themselves, and that despise it in all others? And yet there are some of this sort that are persuaded they have a Religion. I am, say they, it may be, as Religious as another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I mock at all Devotion, and devout People. If they believe what they say, they are certainly cheated by their own Hearts, and we must own these men are truly profane. Others there are that esteem Devotion in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but care not for it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; it cannot accommodate it self to the Spirit of the World, which these men idolize: they approve De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and admire it, but for their own parts, they think they may be saved with less trouble. I know not which are best, these or the others, but that these I think, are somewhat nearer the disposition I would have; but alas, their Conscience is but yet
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42872:146"/> in a very bad Condition! They are in this worse than the others, that they sin against their Sense and Light, they know their Masters Will, but do it not. They are afraid of doing too much, and provided they may be saved, they are not much concerned. How, Strange fansie! deserves not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise to be purchas'd at the rate of Tears, and Prayers, and some hours of Humiliation? How can we think of gaining Heaven at the lowest Price, since 'tis so difficultly to be gotten at any? <hi>If the Righteous shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?</hi> Believe ye, O you Lukewarm Souls, that a true Devout one has not too much Righteousness, to smooth his way to Heaven? Know ye not that all the World commends that saying of St. <hi>Austin, Woe to the best of mens lives, if examin'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy!</hi> and that of <hi>David, If thou Lord shouldst be extreme to mark what is done amiss, who may abide it!</hi> And if these true devout men have

                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:42872:148"/> not too much Righteousness, you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will be found wanting, you who lag so far behind: But God you say, will supply what is wanting, and 'tis for that that Christ died, to wit, to perfect his Grace amidst our sins and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. But how do you know that Jesus Christ will do this? does he not bestow his Grace when and where he pleases? You ought therefore to take the surest side. What assurance have you, that God gives his Grace in that manner, to those that despise it? Do you what possibly you can, Gods mercy will have enough to do, and your Righteousness, though car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as far as all your strength will bear you, will have need enough of help and aid, to your attaining to his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Others there are, that are a step nearer to Devotion, and that is all: they would willingly enough have this (what d'ye call it), Devotion? But they are not arriv'd so far as to the desiring it, that is, the motions of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42872:148"/> their wills to it, are very lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. I would be Devout, they cry, but I can't: the World carries me off, my Affairs take me up, my Temper and my Mind are not made for it, they have not that Turn that's necessary to the practice of this Vertue: I do that which I would not, and I do not that which I would: for the Law of my Members rules over the Law of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: But they are not much troubled at not having what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and that's a certain Proof that they desire it very weakly. O how far are Consciences in this Estate, from Perfection! This is not to love God with <hi>all the heart,</hi> but to seek him by halves, and desire him very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. To desire Devotion at this rate, is to take the way never to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, for the Soul surmounts these Difficulties only by stifly standing up against them, and acting with all its vigour: Judge if a Heart thus cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly and cold can obtain even any
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42872:149"/> thing that is difficult in this World. We have seen how many mighty Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions ruin and destroy Devotion, the Love of the World, its Pleasures, and its Troubles and Perplexities; if to these violent Passions you oppose none but a few imperfect languid Wishes, 'twill be like a Combat betwixt Dwarfs and mighty Giants.</p>
                  <p>The first Advice therefore that I give for the obtaining Devotion, is- <hi>to desire it earnestly.</hi> You will say, perhaps, that this is not necessary, since they who so desire it have it already. There are Movements of which we are not Masters, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we passionately wish for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we cannot do, though it depends upon our own Will. The Tyranny of Habits is very terrible, and the Bonds of Sin are hard to break. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> sets forth these Movements of a Soul that would raise it self to God but cannot, in a heavenly manner. <q>O my God, I sighed and breath'd after the liberty of thinking
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42872:149"/> upon nothing but on thee, but I sigh'd and breath'd when I was then held fast, not by anothers Chains and Bonds, but by my own Will that was harder than any Iron. The Devil kept me in his power, he made a Chain and linked me in it. O fain I would have serv'd thee with a Love all pure, and have enjoyed my God in whom alone true solid Joys are to be found, but this new Will, that did but just bud out, was not able to overpower the old one, that was strengned in its Evils by long Habits.</q> This is the true Picture of a Christian Soul, that desires indeed to be Devout, and would fain think on nothiing else but God, and love him only, but alas cannot. But such a Soul is near Devotion yet, and near to Happiness. When one seeks after God, one is just upon the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. It is this hunger and thirst after Righteousness, to which our Lord assures a blessed satisfaction and fulfilling: These Desires are the effects
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42872:150"/> of Grace, and if Nature does nothing in vain, much less does Grace: These Desires cannot be still in vain, they shall obtain their End, they shall one day be satisfied. There is hardly any thing but the vigour of a Soul, and the force of strong desires shall some time or other compass: it was by this way, rather than the force of Arms that <hi>Alexander</hi> overcame the World, vanquish'd so many Kingdoms, took so many Cities, and gain'd so many Battles. When all things necessary to the accomplishng his designs failed him, the vigour of his Courage, that is to say the force of his desires, stood him in stead of every thing beside; and if desires can do such mighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on things that are without, and independent on our Wills, what can they not effect on that which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on our selves, and is no other Thing but our Will it self?</p>
                  <p>And that these good Desires may be successful, we must call on God for his help. They are the Children
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42872:150"/> he hath brought forth himself, and is concerned to feed and nourish them. 'Tis the Morning of that Sun, that fails not to shine out at full, if we but call upon him ardently. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is another Advice that naturally follows the foregoing one; We must ask of God the grace of Devotion, and sigh before him, that we have it not. If there be any answering Vows and Prayers, if there be any Gift that comes immediately from Heaven, it is this Vertue; for there is nothing purer, nor more elevated among all the Christian Vertues. <hi>Dost thou want Wisdom,</hi> saith S. <hi>James, ask it of God, who giveth to all, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth none.</hi> And I know not if there be any thing or part of Christian Wisdom more desireable than this. We ask of God our daily Bread, our Food and Rayment, health of Body, and cure of Sickness and ease of all our Evils; but the Soul is very sick, and very poor, and ready to starve and die for want of Devotion, which is
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42872:151"/> its Fire, its Soul and its life. In a word, there is nothing to which we can more certainly apply the Promise of S. <hi>James, That God refuseth none, but gives to all men liberally;</hi> for that's the Prayer of the World, that pleases him best, since it tends to his Glory and our own Salvation. We desire of God that he would come into Us, that we also may dwell in Him, and by this mutual Tie be perfectly Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And how should not this be pleasing to God, since our Lord Jesus Christ, the Model of our Actions and our Thoughts, hath asked it already for us? Let me be in them, and thou in me, that we may be united all in one.</p>
                  <p>We should have begun our Advices there; and so the good Man should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his work there; for if we can do nothing without God, which has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or relation to him, how should we do without him, what immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends and terminates upon Him?</p>

                     <head>MEDITATION.</head>
                     <p>I consult with my Heart, to know if I can say with any truth; <hi>My Soul longeth after thy Courts; and as the Hart pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the water Brooks, so longeth my Soul after thee, O God. My Soul gaspeth after thee as a thirsty Land, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh when shall I enter in, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the presence of God!</hi> but alass I find no such Thoughts as these with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me; I find there a great dryness, and a general privation of the Graces of Heaven: there I find only some few languishing Desires, that die as soon as they are born. My Faith is wavering, my Charity is cold, my Hope is weak, my Zeal is half extinguished, and my Devotion lukewarm. Awake then, O my Soul to day, if thou wouldst be united to thy God, if thou wouldst love and be beloved of him: if thou wouldst have him kindle in thee the pure Flames of Devotion, thou must desire it and must ask it earnestly. This good, this great good will very well deserve, that thou shouldst move the first, and try to get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; Say not, my Heart, that thou art bound by thy accursed Chains, and that thy Flesh and Blood calls thee still back, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42872:152"/> thee otherwise; that thou wouldst fain be good, but canst not; that thou desirest it this moment, but canst not desire it long. Alass, my Soul, if thou wert thus willing, the thing would be done; the Chains of thy Will are voluntary Chains; thy Bonds are evil Habits and engagements of Corruption, that are so far from extenuating thy fault, that they increase it. In these kind of things one does all that one will, and when one does not so, it is because we will it with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Will.</p>

                     <p>O my good Father, and my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Saviour! I know too well that I am not truly devout, because I would not be so. But oh, however voluntary the Bonds are that tye my will to evil, and particularly to Indevotion, they are nevertheless strong, and nevertheless indissoluble. My Corruption is in my Will, and therefore I cannot vanquish it by my Will only: thy Grace is sufficient, but without it I can do nothing. Come then, Come, my Deliverer, break thou these Chains under whose
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42872:152"/> weight I groan. I will not let thee go before thou blessest me. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> Let the Spirit of Liberty support me; 'twould be to little purpose to seek for Aid and Counsel, to help my Devotion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee; without thee all Designs must want success, all Counsels sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie just nothing. Except thou keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the City and the House, the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waketh but in vain, and all our Labours are to little purpose. Hear my Prayers, O my God, and let my Meditations bring forth fruit: ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thy holy Word, by the help of thy holy Spirit, that it may kindle in my heart the fire of Zeal; and I may quickly be delivered from those wretched Coldnesses that trouble and torment me, and may be filled with Devotion as full as I desire and wish to be.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The second general Advice to lead a holy Life in the practice of all Vertue.</head>
                  <p>WE have already said something of the Necessity of living well, to the becoming truly devout; but the Subject is of too great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to stop there. Let us then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that there can be no stricter U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than that betwixt God and a faithful Soul, in Acts of Devotion: 'tis head to head, if I may so speak, 'tis a secret Commerce, 'tis seeing God face to face to face, and speaking to him as a Man speaks to his Friend: All that can be conceived of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt Man and his Wife, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, Body and Member, is not yet strong enough to represent the Union of a Soul, that is flying to Heaven on the Wings of Faith and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42872:153"/> Hope, and to which God hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the inestimable Treasures of his Grace: God enters into her, and she into God, and they are but one whole. But he that sees not it is necessary to purifie himself as God is pure, to even and smooth his way to Heaven, sees nothing as he should. The Light of Heaven suffers no Dawn, that is to say, mixture of Day and Night. God who is all Light, cannot unite with a Soul that is in darkness and obscurity.</p>
                  <p>If there be any Vertue to which we owe the blessed Spirits Presence with us, 'tis Devotion. Now we know sufficiently what 'tis that can obtain this blessed Spirits presence. 'Tis not the Magnificence of the House, but the Cleanness; When the wicked Spirit is gone forth of the House, and at his return finds it swept and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, he is ashamed, and cannot enter in again, without the help of six more Spirits, worser than the first. That which drives the wicked Spirit
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42872:154"/> away, draws thither the holy one, who never makes our Heart his Temple, but when all filthiness is banish'd thence. When <hi>Moses</hi> had hewn and polish'd the two Tables, God then engraved his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on them. A Painter cleans his Cloath be sure before he draws his Princes Picture. We have two flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tables of our Heart, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and the Will; but we must not hope that God will write his Laws, or the holy Ghost draw out his Image there, unless it first be cleans'd and polish'd. Devout and pious Soul, that desirest to see God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Thee, and his Love within thy Heart, cleanse the Table of thy Understanding, from so many Errors, Prejudices, and vain Imaginations, and evil Thoughts; and cleanse the Table of thy Will, from so many criminal Inclinations and vicious Habits. And when these Tables are become white Blanks, God will undoubtedly come down, and grave his Image in them.</p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:42872:154"/>
                  <p>Devotion is an entry into Gods Closet; and without the Wedding Garment is no entring there; if one is not adorned with Faith, and Hope and Charity: if one is not cloathed with the Lord Jesus, and bowels of Mercy, and the Spirit of Patience, and Righteousness and Innocence. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is an Exaltation of Soul, and sins are Clogs and Weights; if we oppress this Soul with Weights, how shall it raise it self? We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore discharge our Hearts, to day of one, and to morrow of another sin. One day we must acquit it of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; another, we must set upon Pride; next day Ambition: and thus thy Heart will be disingag'd and thy Devotion be at liberty. But above all, we must remember that the Heart is the most delicate and tender Thing to deal with in the World; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing must be done to put it in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; We must take it down gently, and set it safe again with abundance of care and pains. 'Tis the Eye of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42872:155"/> the Soul, and every little Moat of dust is sufficient to put it almost out. 'Tis as Milk that is turn'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the motion of the Air: 'Tis as a Lute that is put out of Tune even by the unevenness of the Weather. True Sanctification hath more parts than a Lute has strings: and this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Heart is ruined by any one part disordered, as one false Sound quite spoils the harmony of all the Concert: and therefore we must look to it, and every part of it with all the care and tenderness imaginable. The Soul is like a Sea, and its Passions are like Winds: if we keep not in these Passions, they will raise up terrible Storms and Tempests in this Sea, in whose loud noise, Devotion which is a peaceable and gentle Vertue never will be heard. Each Passion will transport the Heart along with it, and poor Devotion a Stranger and alone by it self, will never recover it again. There is most certainly a very near alliance between Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42872:155"/> they come from the same Source, and the same Heart produces them. Therefore I think a Man cannot better dispose his Mouth to sing Gods Praises, his Mind to contemplate on his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Works, and his Soul to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and raise it self than by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of good Works. We have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said that a Man is ill dispos'd for works of Devotion, that is just come from a Ball or Comedy. I say now on the other hand, that when a man is come from the house of Mourning, where he hath comforted the Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, succoured the Miserable, supported the Weak, fed the Needy, and rescued the Oppressed; he finds himself so gay, and so dispos'd to Prayer and Praise, that 'tis not easily to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. He comes to God with the sprightliness and comfort, that a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant comes with to his Master for the Reward he promis'd him, when he had done his duty: for though he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges he can merit nothing of Gods hand, yet he knows very well,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42872:156"/> that God rewardeth that in us, which we could never have done without the assistance of his Grace. He comes to Gods Altar with the assurance of a faithful Subject, approaching his Prince with Presents he is sure will make him way to his favour. For though our best works are but very imperfect gifts, and have even all that is good in them from his liberality, yet he knows that God accepts them as though they were of great Price. I will not make any difficulty to say, that both the Ancient and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ones who have distinguished the Christian Active Life from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, and have believed that this surpassed that, and was much more excellent than the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I will not stick to say, they are greatly mistaken. For in separating the Active Life which consists in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to ones Neighbour, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising Charity towards the miserable and needy, from the Contemplative Life to which they believ'd they might
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42872:156"/> wholly give themselves up, they have undoubtedly deprived their Devotion of a great Help. I have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that the employments of <hi>Martha</hi> which respect the bodily Service of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and of his Members, should not take up that time that is devoted to the Works of <hi>Mary,</hi> that is, to Meditation, Reading, and Prayers. But we have time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all: when <hi>Mary</hi> hath heard enough, it is but fit, that she should take her Sister <hi>Martha</hi>'s place. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would not counsel him, that would attain to perfect Devotion, to renounce that part of the World that is made up of the afflicted Members of our Lord. 'Tis the School of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, and the practice of works of Mercy and Compassion is so far from distracting devout Souls, that 'tis the shortest and the surest way to arrive at Devotion by. The Ideas of the World, I own, are incompatible with those that should fill a devout Soul; a sad Event, some noble Sight,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42872:157"/> the hopes of a Fortune for your self, the greatness of anothers, a Combat, a War; all these, I say, and the like, have no Alliance with the sweet I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of God, his Love, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and Favour: and therefore it is good to shut the door at first to these Ideas, if you would labour with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in the establishing others: but the Images of one that languishes, or suffers for Gods sake, are easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the Image of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour suffering for us. A multitude of poor, on whom thou openest thy Bowels, will quickly lead thee to the consideration of the bounteous Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality that thou receivest from God. The help thou lendest any one, to defend his Life, or another his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, will oblige thee to remember the Benefits, and Succours thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest continually from Heaven. Thou never wilt have need to banish the Thoughts of this Nature, that follow the Active Life, to lodge in their room, those that arise from Contemplation:
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42872:157"/> they will unite in the same Heart, and lend each other mutual Aids.</p>

                     <p>I have been often told, that the Vertues are Sisters, that all of them go hand in hand; that they are as so many Rings of a blessed Chain, that is broken as soon as one of them is lost. They cannot be alone one from the other; and therefore, my Soul, thou canst not be truly devout, because thou art not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertuous, and takest not to heart the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of good works. Dost thou not see the World is made expresly on purpose to furnish matter for the exercise of all thy Vertues, and to sollicit thee to good and holy Actions? The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work, That thou mightest join thy voice in consort, with those Praises that all Nature sings, and by which thou makest thy Acknowledgments. The Air forms Storms and Tempests, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Lightnings, to create in thee the fear of God, and make thee tremble under his hand, who makes the Mountains shake. Dost thou not see, that God makes some men miserable in this World, that they may be the Objects of thy Pity; poor, that thou mayst be

Does he not even suffer men to sin, and wander from the way, that thou mayst set them right again; ignorant, that thou mayst instruct them; imprudent, that thou mayst advise; some to fall, that thou mayst raise them up again, and look to thy own steps: and even some wretched ones that suffer much, nay pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, that thou mayst be possessed with a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fear? Does he not suffer examples of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that thou mayst despise the World; sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, unlook'd for Deaths, that thou mayst watch and be upon thy guard; proud men to fall to ruin, that thou mayst still be kept hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the wicked to be punish'd; that thou mayst abhor Vice; and good men rewarded, that thou mayst seek and follow after Virtue? And amidst so many Lessons, thou art quite deaf and unconcerned: thou makest thy Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, O my Soul, consist in doing nothing ill, that is, in doing nothing; as if one should make life consist in death, and a privation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thou callst not to mind that the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Fig-tree is cut off at the root, and that God will cast out the unprofitable Servant, and banish out of Paradice both the Servant that shall have lost his Tallent, and him that that only wrapp'd it up in a Napkin.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Third general Advice, for the Help of Devotion; to guard the Senses, and keep the Soul as it were lock'd up.</head>
                  <p>THERE is so great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce betwixt the Heart and Senses, that one shall try in vain to guard the one, if he does not also guard the other. The Heart is the House, the Senses are the Gates and Windows: 'Tis by them the Devil enters in and seizes on our Souls. This Enemy plants as many Batteries without as we have outward Senses,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42872:159"/> and if we scape at one Port, he kills us at another. But this we must say, to discharge the Senses, that they are rather miserable than criminal, they act as they are made to act, or rather suffer according to the Laws of the Creator; and even the greatest part of Ideas that come to them are Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and are only spoiled by coming to the Heart. The Beauty of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the lustre of Gold and Jewels, the sweetness of Musick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the works of God, and consequently good, but the Heart corrupts those innocent Images. However, because the Heart cannot empoison any other Objects but such as are presented to it, one should remove from it all matters and occasions of its Crimes, and ill Habits would undoubtedly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for want of Employ. And therefore 'tis of absolute necessity, to keep a watchful guard over the Senses. <hi>I made a Covenant with mine Eyes,</hi> said holy <hi>Job, that they should not behold a Maid.</hi> It hath always been the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42872:160"/> practice of such as would be truly Devout, to keep their Souls shut in from the multitude of Objects, that surround them on all hands. 'Tis true, they have carried up this Maxim to the greatest Superstition imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Some have betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Desarts, that they might see nothing: Others have lock'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up in Cells, never to go out; and History tells us of a <hi>Solitary</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that would never so much as give his own Sister the satisfaction of seeing him; at last he received Order from his Superiour, at the Prayers of Saint <hi>Athanasius,</hi> to go and visit her: Thither he came, and with his Eyes shut, presented himself before her, and saw her not, but said, <hi>Come satisfie thy self quickly and see me,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. These Excesses do more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Reason. than they afford help to Devotion. The Soul draws great advantages from the Senses, when it can make right use of them. To shut up all Avenues by which Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42872:160"/> and knowledge pass into the Soul, is to keep it in a dark prison, and feed it with Ignorance. The truth is this, 'tis dangerous to let it out, to evil Objects, because thereby 'tis taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and but ill dispos'd for Piety and Devotion. And 'tis no less dangerous to let it out too much on indifferent Objects, because this dissipates and weakens its strength, and it still brings back with it an Air of Vanity from the Objects it has long dwelt upon.</p>
                  <p>This is the way of living in the World, we are visited, and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, we are expos'd to Conversation, that is to say, the contagion that comes from every Thing and Place. The Eyes are always open to let in new Objects, the Ears to hear News, our Conversations are all of them vain, we say a thousand silly and impertinent things, and many more bad, than good or indifferent: One entertains you with a discourse of dressing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justing, another with some trifling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue of the neighbourhood; another
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42872:161"/> fills your Breast with slanders and back-bitings; another shews you his fine house, and a new building: One comes a Traveller, and he tells stories of the new world, and enlarges with lies and wonders of his own making, and you return to your houses with your heads fill'd with Rattles and Fooleries. And when you would enter your Closet, your Hearts are but ill dispos'd for the duties of that place. And therefore 'tis harder to be devout, in great and frequented Cities, where one cannot lightly hinder these kind of Amusements. I advise therefore the faithful Soul to keep it self reserv'd: The Souls of Worldlings are like fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented high streets, open to all comers and goers, and one is always in a Croud, and Devotion that loves to be private and still, is not at all pleased in these publick places. They are common Inns where all Strangers are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Master often forc'd to ly out. But the Hearts of the Faithful should be private to themselves, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42872:161"/> God that is the Master should be there at large. <hi>A Garden enclosed is my Sister, my Spouse, a Spring shut up, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sealed;</hi> says Jesus Christ to his Spouse, that is, to every Christian Soul. Shut this Garden if thou wouldst preserve the Flowers, and Fruits, and suffer not thy clean Springs to be mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by impure unclean Beasts. Temples and Oratories should not be accessible to the prophane. Our Hearts are the Temples of the Holy Ghost, let us shut the gates then, to a thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet Ideas, and a thousand vain Objects that would prophane them. The Soul is like a Vessel that Grace fills full with sweet Odours, but if we give it too much Air, they all evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and leave it scentless and insipid. When a Vessel is full, it can receive no more, without losing something of what it had before. If it is full of Devotion, and we carry it into the World, as it fills with Vanities, so that which was good in it evaporates and goes out. This is a Truth that we
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42872:162"/> should often think on, that every time we go out, as it were, into the World, we lose something we had: <hi>Dinah</hi> would needs go out and see the Daughters of the Country, but there she lost her loveliest Ornament, her Honour and Virginity: but let us especially remember, that in seeking out Innocent Objects, we often find Criminal ones: the Devil lies in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush every where, and hath strowed his nets with Flowers: Sin reigns in every place, so that let us go astray never so little, we undoubtedly meet with it, and tis very much, if it is not always to our cost. But what shall we say of those, that go with settled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and designs, to places, where they know Sin reigns and Satan triumphs? After having lost half their day in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the Play-house, they give the Devil tother half, and plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Hell: these are People that are wilful Murderers of their Souls for which God will require a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and terrible account. I conclude
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42872:162"/> all this, that a devout person should be very reserv'd from the World, should make and receive but few visits, and break themselves as they well can, of the vain curiosity of knowing all that passes. 'Tis enough for a good Soul, to know what passes in its own Heart, and to order its Thoughts and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What signifies it, to learn, what becomes of such a Fleet, what was the event of such a Battle, how such a Negotiation succeeded, how the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace, and Preparations of War go on? The knowledge of all this makes a man no whit the happier. But the Ideas of these things that stick in his memory, will not fail to make an Irruption on his Heart, and disturb him in the midst of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>

                     <p>How happy wilt thou be, my Soul, when thou shalt be in a place, where thou shalt have nothing to fear; where thou mayst take thy flight, walk out, and wander where thou wilt, fly over an infinity of Objects, and give thy self intirely up to contemplation, and diversity of thoughts! this happiness will be thine, when thou shalt come to Heaven. There every Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will declare thy Duty, and sollicit thy Obedience. There thou wilt fear no longer Snakes under the Flowers, nor that the Devil lies in ambuscade in those blest places, whither thy mind and steps will carry thee. Thy Soul enlarged, shall fear no farther dissipation, or wast of strength, it shall embrace all Objects, without the fear of being over-run. And thou shalt be fill'd with an Infinity of very different Images, yet shall not God be less within thee, for all those Images shall be holy ones, and Friends of God. Now 'tis not so, thou canst not take one step, without incurring danger; thou canst not stir from home, not from thy self, but thou must meet an Enemy, that seeks for and demands thy death and ruin: Thou canst not admit into thy Breast, those numerous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that croud in at thy Senses, but thou must
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42872:163"/> fill thy Heart therewith, and take from God the room that he alone should fill and take up. Make not therefore so many sallies into the World, for thou wilt still lose something by it. Include thy self within the compass of thine own Heart, if it is not large, tis deep, and thou wilt there find exercise enough. Thou wilt never be able to sound it, it cannot be known by any but by him that tries the very thoughts and reins. But dive at least as deep as well thou canst. Examine thou thy self, and the knowledge of that which passes within thee, will be of more use, than of all that passes in the World besides. Concern not thy self with the Wars and Intrigues of State, with publick or with private Matters. Take cognizance of the wars and strifes within, of thy flesh and spirit, betwixt the Law of thy Members, and that of thy Understanding. Pacifie those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, teach the flesh to be subject, replace thy Reason on its Throne, and give it Piety for its chief Councellor, tame thy Appetite, and bring thy Passions under bondage. Put this thy little State in good order, govern wisely and holily that great People in this little King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. That is, the multitude of Affections, Thoughts, Opinions, and Passions, that are in thy Heart.</p>

Take thou the Reins, and lead my Soul, and suffer it not to stray and wander out, and to lose it self in Errors. Stop the stream of it's Passions, and the fury of it's Motions, that it may recollect it self within it self, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in it's own Affairs, and think of preparing room for thee, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thee, and wholly possessing thee; to contemplate upon nothing else, but banish all other Ideas; and by these means dispose it self for the exercises of Devotion.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Fourth General Advice: to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in Holy Exercises, and not to be discouraged at any Difficulties.</head>
                  <p>WE have not represented Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a thing lightly to be obtain'd: And therefore a good Soul must not be surpris'd when it meets with Difficulties, much less, must it be discouraged and lose heart: This is a new advice I give to obtain it. Every good Soul has had experience, that in trying to raise it self to God, it hath found the Wings of its Devotion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entangled with the Vanities of the World, or by the Sluggishness of the Flesh; In this estate, if it relax or give back, tis lost; it must, to these so necessary desires, add Action and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: <hi>Solomon,</hi> in his <hi>Proverbs,</hi> speaks of the motion of the Sluggard, as if all his strength were spent and drained in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42872:165"/> vain and fruitless wishes and desires; he makes the finest resolutions in the World but he never stirs from the place he is in. And <hi>Solomon</hi> may well mean the Sluggishness of the Soul hereby, for there is hardly a Chapter in which he does not hit it very home: This is the Vice of those who exhaust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves quite, in praising Vertue, so that they have no strength left to pursue and attain to it. The false Devout ones do the same; they praise it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it, but the first Temptation that meets them utterly confounds and throws them down. But dost thou not know, that all great things are hard to come by? Does a Pilot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his Vessel, at the first rude gust of Wind? A Rower that makes against the stream, does he not set himself with resolution against the fury of the Current? He still makes on, takes Courage, and at last surmounts the difficulty. A Tradesman leaves not off his Calling for one Loss, nor a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier his Hopes, for one shrewd turn of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42872:165"/> Fortune; but all of them try to regain by their diligence what they have lost by disgrace or ill luck: and so should we set our selves strongly against Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and when we find our Hearts but ill disposed, and our Motions lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, and our Devotions crossed and distracted, we must do violence to our selves, and check our hearts, till we have brought them to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again. We must pray, read, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and think in spight of its teeth. <hi>Altho,</hi> says St. <hi>Basil, The Devil fill your heart with evil Thoughts, yet you must not for that leave the exercise of prayer. You must make new efforts, and greater yet; you must pray to God that it would please him, to break down the thick wall of vain Thoughts that hold us separate from him, we must ask of him that our Soul may quickly come to him, without being hindred by any vain and wicked Thoughts, or Objects: And tho the Enemy should come again with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of new distractions, yet we must not yield, or lose courage, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42872:166"/> to victory in the midst of the fight. We must persevere till God, seeing our Constancy, shall come, and fill us with the Light of his Spirit, put to flight the Enemy, purifie our Ʋnderstandings, and furnish our Reason with a Divine Light, by which our Soul being possessed in peace and patience, freed from all Tempests, may serve God with a perfect joy.</hi> The Saint insinuates this for a reason, to support us in our resolutions of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; namely, that the Devil never leaves to tempt us, neither must we leave off resisting him; as our resistance discourages not him, so neither should his Temptations discourage us. God who is spectator of our Combats, and the rewarder of our Labours, beholds with pleasure, a faithful Soul amidst infirmities and distractions, though ready very near to yield and fall, and comes at last himself, and with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand rescues and plucks him out of danger.</p>
                  <p>Perseverance is a Vertue of great use; tis to it we owe the fairest works
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42872:166"/> of Nature, Art, and Grace. If God had left the World imperfect, instead of a Wonder he had made a monstrous Prodigy. There are some Works in special, to which the last and finishing hand is so essential, that if they be not perfected, that which was begun is utterly thrown away and lost. If you draw but the first lines of a Picture, they will last on the cloath; but if you bring a Wheel to the middle ascent of a Hill, and let it go for a minute, it will run to the bottom of the Vale, and your labour will not only be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but quite undone and spoil'd, as if you never had done any thing. Devotion is of this last sort of things, leave it half done, and all is lost. Tis <hi>Penelopes</hi> Webb. The night undoes the labour of the day. If thy life is not one perpetual day, and thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourest not incessantly to advance in Piety by Exercise; one single night, formed up of the darkness of Indevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the absence of Grace, will ruin a work of many years; and a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42872:167"/> moments Relaxation and Idleness will destroy what ever the Courage and Pains of a long time had produc'd: But there is nothing but Perseverance will in its time accomplish. Thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, O Christian Soul, is nothing as yet but a Spark: O, dearly feed this Holy Flame, blow it incessantly, heap round it all the combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou canst, make thee a treasure of good things, turn often towards Jesus Christ, thy Sun, and Star, and that small spark, will, going on, become a great fire; this fire will cause great burnings, these burnings will throw out flames, and these flames will carry thee to Heaven: But if thou neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est this little spark, it will quickly die and go out. <hi>Samson</hi> gave himself up into the hands of <hi>Dalila,</hi> and slept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her knees, she cuts off his hair, in which his strength lay, and he awakens, and essays to go out according to his custom, and bear away the Gates of <hi>Gath,</hi> and break the bonds of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> but alas he finds himself no
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42872:167"/> longer the same man. So the good Soul that relaxes from his dayly Devotion, and sleeps in the arms of Pleasure, his heart is enervated; he thinks to return, according to his wont, to his commerce with God; but the Devil sets upon him, and overpowers him with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of evil Thoughts, under which his Devotion lies bound, as it were, with so many Chains.</p>
                  <p>Should the Heavens but stand still one day, it may be, there would be an Universal overturn of all Nature: at least, all things below must suffer some considerable damage. When the upper part of the Soul stops its divine motions, one cannot question but there rises great disorder in the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part. For the passions that are still check'd, manage besure these hours of relaxation, to prepare for a revolt. We must therefore be sure to back our Piety and Devotion with the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the quickness, and the regularity of Heavens motions, to the end this little world may always be in good
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42872:168"/> condition. Nothing should hinder, nothing interrupt the course of our Devotion. Consider <hi>Daniel,</hi> whom all the terrors of death could not stop in his divine course of Praying at his seasons. He must be thrown into the Lions den, if he but call on God, but this does not hinder him from prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself, at his hours, towards <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But especially, we must get as far as we can from that custom men have gotten, of running into the business of the world as into a croud, to shelter themselves from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Let us give to God, above all, that which belongs unto him, and trouble not our selves with what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the rest. They say the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent secures his head, when he is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, and exposes his body when he cannot preserve his head; the hours devoted to the exercise of Piety are the head of our life, and tis a holy prudence not to expose them, but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from danger, for fear the Devil and the World should take them
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42872:168"/> and devour them. In fine, I say that Perseverance in Devotion, is better than its violent excesses. 'Tis better to march by slow and little steps, but constantly, than to make swift courses, but interrupted ones. There are some that have fits of Devotion for a day; there is nothing in the World so ardent, so humble, and so warmly affected: but to morrow the stream of Tears, is so well drained, and dried up, that you can hardly perceive any tokens of the concern. The burning of this Feavour is so abated, that one cannot find the least heat. A constant medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity is to be prefer'd before these warm Excesses of such short continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Not that I think, Devotion should not have its feasts, and times of refreshment, and raise it self extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily upon some certain days, and occasions. These are the exceedings of Devotion, to which we should aspire as oft as we well can; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially never fail on time designed and appropriated to Holy Works, such as
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42872:169"/> participating of the Holy Sacrament of Christs Body and Blood. But I would have the Soul, besides these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries, have its ordinary course of Piety well govern'd. And if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always have its extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as were to be desir'd, yet at least, let it never fall into any shameful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation and Disorders.</p>

                     <p>I should have but too much reason, O my God, to be discouraged, and despair of success in all my designs, if I considered only the greatness of the enterprise, the difficuties that occur, and the meanness of my Forces, or to say better, my Weakness and my Nothingness. I desire great Things, for I desire to be One with God. I would become like him, I would renew his Image in me, I would cleanse my Heart that Sin hath sullied and defiled, I would raise that great Edifice that Sin and the Devil have thrown down, I would ascend the Throne, I would be a King and Priest to God my Father. But Oh my Soul, where dost thou find strength enough in thee, for these great
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42872:169"/> Things, thou who art Darkness, Weakness, and Impurity it self? Although thou hadst no other Enemy but the Devil, how couldst thou vanquish that Red Dragon, with Seven Heads and Ten Horns? that Cursed Serpent from the beginning of the World, empoisoned with his Breath and VVords our first Parents; he at this day Infects the Springs and Sources where we go to Drink, he lays his Snares in all our ways, and Netts in all our Paths; but above all, he never makes greater Attempts to ruin us, than when we make any, to unite our selves to God by Prayer and by Devotion. Then he stirs up the Fantomes of our Imagination, to take us from the presence of our God. He lifts up the floods of our Passions, and our Concupiscence, to draw us from the safe Port. 'Tis true, he has a great deal of reason so to use us, for, O my Soul, thou never fightest with such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and success, as by Prayer, when it is fervent and devout. Therefore he stirs up Heaven and Earth to Distract thee, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire thee with Sentiments of Coldness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference: but flatter not thy self, my Heart, if thou seest not this Enemy with the Eyes of thy Flesh dart out his Javelins at thee, yet he is Speaking, Attacking, and Tempting thee by the Mouth of thy Concupiscence, that never fails him, and hath made a League with him:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42872:170"/> But lose not Courage, O my Heart, although thou canst do nothing of thy self, thou canst do all things through thy Saviour that strengthens thee.

Let thy Grace heal the Wounds his bitings have made upon my Soul. Support me in the difficulties, that this dreadful Foe creates me, and makes me meet in the Exercise of Devotion. When I enter my Closet, or thy Church, be to me as a Wall of Brass and Fire, to defend me from
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42872:170"/> the approaches of wicked Spirits. So that under the Wings of thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and thy Love, I may live, during these few moments on Earth, in a tranquil and calm Air, and in security and peace, by the favour of which I may Consecrate all my Thoughts, my Will, my Heart, my Vnderstanding and Imaginations to thee and thy Service, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be able to withdraw me from thy Bosome.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Fifth General Advice: to have God always before ones Eyes.</head>
                  <p>THis is a Remedy against a great many Evils, but in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner against Indevotion. I shall shortly say, that the faithful Soul should have its hours of Meditation; during which, it expresly draws over again in its mind▪ the Image of the Deity, and awakens the remembrance
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42872:171"/> of its Benefits and Graces; but this is not what I would at present say. I speak now of that continual, and as it were, habitual Thought of God that never should forsake and leave us. 'Tis a most Spiritual and delicate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, that comes a crosse, and steales from the business of the World, time to Consecrate it to Gods Service. 'Tis a sublime operation of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, enlightned with the Lights of Grace, that finds out God in every thing, concerns him in all our Actions, and singles him out from every other Object. 'Tis an Action of the Soul, by which, in the midst of humane affairs, it turns it self without any violence on the side of God, by a habit it has gotten. It orders matters so that every thing is, as it were, a ladder by which it mounts to Heaven, and every Object shews and entertains him with his God. An Artisan in the midst of his Works, a Mariner in the midst of his Voyages, and a Scholar in the midst of his Readings will find
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42872:171"/> means to Sanctifie what he is about, by concerning God in his business, and bringing him thither by his pious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Reflexions. Faithful Soul, let the Lamb follow thee, wherever thou goest, that thou one day mayst follow him, wherever he shall goe; if thou layest thee on thy Bed, think on our Lords Sepulchre, who for thy sake entred the Chambers of Death. Art thou composing thy self to sleep, Oh think of Jesus Christ, whose bessed Eyes the sleep of Death for thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion closed. A new born Infant will bring to thy mind the humility of thy Lord in his Birth. A Wretch that suffers for his Sins, will make thee think on Jesus Christ that suffered on the Cross for thine. A man that asks thee for Relief, tells thee, our Lord was made poor that thou mightst be be made rich. In a Word, from every thing thou mayest find an occasion to think on God. What shall I say of the Objects in Nature that will bring their great Author into thy mind, even against
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42872:172"/> thy mind? If thou risest in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thou canst not see the rising Sun, without reflecting on the great Creator of that cheif masterpiece of all the World, and without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Sun of thy Soul, that spreads abroad his Rays of Grace into thy Heart, to dissipate thy Darkness. The Trees, the Rivers, Mountains, Woods and Corn-fields, the Fruits, the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and every thing, will present thee with thy God. <hi>For the Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Glory of God, and the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sheweth his handy work.</hi> The Flies and Worms themselves speak thee, O God, since we in them see thy Divinity shine forth. <hi>This Workman</hi> saith St. Austin, <hi>appears great, in great things, but so that he appears no less great, even in the least of all his Work.</hi> We must therefore form a habit of thinking upon God, even whilest we are doing of another thing, and this will be the way to doe that well, we doe at all, and to engage God to operate with us. But there are several Employs that take
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42872:172"/> not a Mans mind intirely up. A La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer at his work, a Woman in her ordinary affairs amongst those of her own Sex, will troul a thousand vain Chimerical Imaginations and Designs in their Heads, and wander and think of a thousand things successively: And what should hinder them from giving to God this part of their Souls, and the attention they steal from the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness they have in hand? Why should they not rather think on their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the Obligations they have to him, and the acknowledgments they owe him, than on some idle Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have had, or some trifling Adventure, whose relation makes them merry? <hi>We must,</hi> says St. Basil, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently guard our Heart, and never suffer it to start from Meditating upon God, for fear the remembrance of his Marvellous Deeds should be lost or stifled in the croud of vain Thoughts. And we must so contrive, that by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Remembrance, these Meditations may become like the Indelible Impression
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42872:173"/> of a Seal and Signet.</hi> This is not so impossible as one may think for, at first; for a truly Devout Soul, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinks on God without any trouble, but very often, without perceiving what it was that introduc'd those Thoughts. <hi>Thy Praises, said</hi> David, <hi>shall be continually in my Mouth.</hi> Upon which the abovenamed Saint goes on, <hi>How can this be? Can a man, amidst the affairs and conversations of the World, have Gods praises always in his Mouth? when he sleeps, when he drinks, when he eats, and when he holds his Tongue, can he sing the praises of God? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> saith he, <hi>there is within a man an intelligible mouth, by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeives the Word of Life, which is the Heavenly Bread, and nothing hinders but he may have Gods Praises always in his Mouth;</hi> and I say moreover, that the thoughts of God, engraved and sealed in the superiour part of the Soul, may be called praises that never leave the heart.</p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:42872:173"/>
                  <p>In a word, one cannot well say, how great a help this is to Devotion. When we must seek for God a great way off, the Soul strayes by the way, but if it have him always near it, it cannot fail of finding him. How easie is it to set the Heart in the Traces of Devotion, and the ways of our Lord, when it never loses sight of him! If you let your Furnace grow quite cold, 'twill put to pain and charges too, to heat it quite anew, but keep the fire a little in, and a little addition will bring it to its necessary Heat. If our Soul grow quite cold, and interrupts its meditating upon God, twill cost us a great deal of trouble to kindle again the flames of our Devotion, and therefore we must always keep the Soul in exercise.</p>
                  <p>This continual thinking upon God, will be a most acceptable and pleasing Sacrifice to him, like the perpetual Morning and the Evening Offerings; like that holy Fire that burnt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon the Altars. In short,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42872:174"/> like an Invocation without ceasing: for, <hi>so mayst thou pray incessantly,</hi> saith S. <hi>Basil, not by pronouncing words of Invocation, but in doing works of Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: If thy Conduct tend only to join, and unite, and make thee like to God, thy life will be as one perpetual and continual Prayer.</hi> Do not doubt, but these continued Sacrifices, this Incense that smoaks perpetually, these implicit, indirect Prayers, that ascend from our Hearts in all places, and at all times, will become most effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious means to render God acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. So that as often as we would unite our selves more straitly to him, by Devotions, and more express Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he will incontinently be found by us, and filling us with his Light; he will carry us with him, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour us with the blessed Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit.</p>

                     <head>MEDITATION.</head>
                     <p>A man is strangely made up: he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of pains, not to do his Duty, and neglects the easiest things, because he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them by God. There is nothing easier than to think on God, there is yet nothing that is less done than this. It seems almost impossible not to think on him, since every Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Senses speaks out his Divinity. O seest thou not, my Soul, his Lines, his Traces, and his Characters in every thing and place? But dost thou not see them in thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science? and is he not in every one of us? 'Tis easie then to think on God, but yet 'tis sweeter too, than easie. Ah, my Soul, if thou wert spiritual and fine enough, and as loose from thy corrupted matter as thou shouldst, thou wouldst take the greatest pleasure and delight imaginable in such Meditation. This great Good, this good God, is as well the most exquisite Beauty, as the only Good. My Eyes admire the light of the Sun, the regularity of its Motions, the Efficacy of its Heat, and the just and ordinary Revolutions of heavenly Bodies. We stand in admiration at humane Beauties, and the Souls whole strength and elevation seem to us Angelical. But thou
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42872:175"/> must know, my Soul, that all these Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are and flow from God, and are indeed but feeble Images of his adorable Majesty. The light of the Sun is but as darkness to him, and the most excellent exalted Souls, are earthy, creeping, wretched Beings, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his incomprehensible Understanding. If thou hadst seen him in his Glory, thou hadst been ravished with Extasies; thou wouldst say, <hi>It is good for me to be here; let me build thee here a Tabernacle;</hi> but alas, thou canst not see him; he is nothing of all thou seest, and all thou feelest. He is no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Light, nor colour for thine Eyes. He is no Voice nor sounding for thine Ears: He is no savour for thy Palate; nor Scent for thy smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; nor any solid Body for thy Touch. Thou seest no part of him, and yet mayst find him every where. Think on him, and thy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will make thee feel, and hold, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess him: Thou wilt see with thy spiritual Eyes, an intelligible Light that effaces all the Beauty of the visible One: Thou wilt hear a heavenly Harmony, that surpasses all the Charms of Musick: Thou wilt tast of Food, whose delicacy and excellence will be beyond I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination; and thou wilt cry, <hi>O tast and see how good and gracious the Lord is!</hi> The Heart is never so well at ease, as when
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42872:175"/>
'tis near its Treasure. Know then, my Soul, God is thy Treasure and true Riches; and therefore follow him continually, seek him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and when thou hast him, never leave him. Should a Woman take delight to think of any thing with so much Joy, as on her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Husband? But God is thy Spouse, my Soul, thy Husband is he that hath made thee, and hath knit thee to him in his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions. Shouldst thou not therefore long to possess him, and seek for his Divine and chast Embraces with incredible Desire and Ardour? Now, thou canst not obtain this favour, but by fixing thy Soul to his Divine Essence, and infinite Perfections by continual Meditation. Get then behind, ye vain and wretched things, that rob me of the Object of my Love. Far hence ye Criminal Affairs that hinder me from thinking on my God.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42872:176"/> Glory: but 'tis because my Eyes are yet unclean, and cannot look upon thee; they are weak, and cannot bear the Splendors of thy Light.

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The first particular Advice: to have ones Hours of Devotion well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, and well chosen.</head>
                  <p>AFTER these general Counsels, it may not be unprofitable to lay down some particular ones: And first I believe it may be a great Help to Devotion to have ones Hours very regular. Man is a Creature of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and Habit, very near as other Creatures are. A Horse, that has got a Custom of going in such a certain Road, will never fail of returning by the same; when his times of feeding are come, he will march to and fro without any more to do. So the Heart returns of it self, without any guidance, or pains, to the things it hath had a custom of doing. Take then your Hours, the Morning, Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Noon, at Nine and Three. Make
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42872:177"/> to your self a Law for some time, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to let those Hours pass, or give them to any thing but to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and your Heart will return to them of it self without any trouble. The parts themselves that are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Understanding are capable of these Habits. When the Stomach has gotten a Custom of Eating at such a certain Hour, if it fail of eating then, it quickly finds that something is wanting. The Conscience is the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of the Soul, give it its Meals at setled Times, and when you fail to do so, it will give you notice. But learn to do no Violence to it, nor sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit it to hold its peace. When once it warns you, amidst your Affairs, that its time is come; put it not off to another Hour, for if you put it out of order, 'tis undone. It will warn you no more, you shall then sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit it; and then the Soul is in a sad State, when Conscience is asleep, and the Heart drowsie, and when one hath need to awaken it by some express re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection made on purpose.</p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:42872:177"/>
                  <p>If you ask me what hours you must chuse, and how many, I shall find some difficulty perhaps to answer; <hi>David</hi> set out seven for himself. Seven times a day doe I praise thee: <hi>Daniel</hi> had three principal ones: Our Lord Jesus Christ withdrew himself for whole nights in the Mountain to pray: How were it to be wished, that we could give God all our time! but alas! the necessities of Nature, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the Flesh hinder that: and I cannot tell of what those devout Men are made, that spend whole days and nights in Meditation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating: I will not pronounce any thing upon them, I leave every one to his Conscience. If we cannot give God all, it is certain at least, we must give him the better part; and of our hours, must destine some that must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him only, and never spent upon the World. The number of them must be set out according to our different strengths, and we must still increase as as our Devotion gets ground. A
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42872:178"/> Child cannot lift a burthen, that a strong Man can carry very easily. Let every one order himself according to his strength. 'Tis good to eat when one is hungry, and to approach to God when the Heart is heated: as often as it comes he will refuse it nothing, and as often as it would come, besure you let it. But observe that when your Appetite is gone, and appears not, you fail not, for that, to give it its set Meals: and you had better eat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hunger, than lose your life for want of Victuals. It is the same thing here, if you are miserable enough to lose this holy Appetite of things Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, stay not till it return; lose not the hours of your Devotion, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Repasts, eat without stomach, and it may be, your Appetite will return and come again, whilst you are eating. Few men in perfect health eat less than twice a day, and even sick folks are made to take some nourishment as often at least, observing only that their Meals be short and light. I think the same
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42872:178"/> course would do well, in the Dieting indisposed Souls, and such as are yet but Novices in the exercise of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We must be forced to return to it often, but by short Exercises, not to disgust the weak and tender Souls.</p>
                  <p>If some Clocks be not wound up once or twice a day, they will leave going, the Weights will touch the ground, and the whole motion ceases: The Soul is like this wonderful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, made up of faculties like wheels and springs, and the weight of the flesh draws them down: Wind them up often, if you would have them go. Strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees: they that look after these machines, take care to wind them up every day at certain hours, otherwise they will be out of order. And this we must observe, in the ordering of our hearts in the matter of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>All hours are good, for the Heavens are always open, and Gods Throne always accessible: But yet there are
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42872:179"/> some much properer than others. Those of the morning are so much and truly Gods, that one cannot rob him of them without a kind of Sacrilege. If God will have the Firstlings of our flocks, much rather will he have the first Hours of our day; and what more proper time to lift our Eyes and Hearts up to the Sun of Righteousness, than when the sensible Sun is rising on the World? Then is the time the Morning Star should rise in our Hearts, and Prayer should open the door of Grace. When can we better lift up our Hearts to God, than at the beginning of a Course or Race, whose success depends entirely on him? in the Morning we must seal up our Hearts with these Holy Thoughts, and busie our Spirits with chast and pure Ideas; that the Corruption of the World, which in the rest of the Day will come, and, by the Senses, give a thousand assaults upon the Heart, may find it bravely fortified. This will be that sweet and heavenly Dew of the Morning, which
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42872:179"/> falling on our Souls, will make them fruitful in good Works the rest of the day. This will be an Antidote against the infected Air of the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot well stir out of doors, nor expose our selves to the meeting so many contagious Objects. As God should be the first thing liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Hearts, so should he also be the last; he calls himself the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end. Let him open then the gate of our Thoughts in the morning, and shut it up at night. This will be a seal and mark the Devils will repect: as naked and disarmed as we are whilst sleeping, they will tremble at our sight, and will not dare to come up to us.</p>
                  <p>The destroying Angel will, as he passes by, have respect to this Seal and Impression, and this Fruit of the Lambs Blood. These Evening Exercises will bear good seed sown in a good Ground, that will not fail to bud and bring forth in the Morning, for the Heart will find no trouble to begin the day, with
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42872:180"/> what he ended the foregoing one. And since 'tis true, that the Soul left to it self in sleep is naturally carried to the last objects of its waking, we need not question very happy Dreams, and those Images that arise from the last Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that Devotion left upon the Heart must needs be sweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
                  <p>The night it self is perfectly a friend to Devotion: 'tis then the Recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are easie, the Soul not being dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and divided by the presence of Objects. Ah, nothing sure is sweeter than to fill the Heart with God, when it is void of all things else. God finds it good that a faithful Soul should make his Bed his Altar, and offer up his Vows in that retirement far from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witnesses. Let thy Body be laid, so thy Soul be up, and thou fall'st down upon the knees of thy Heart, as St. <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> saies, methinks these nightly Commerces with God should and might be more near and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; because, when we are laid in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42872:180"/> Bed, we bid adieu to the Worlds, and banish all disquiets and perplexities from thence, to give the Body its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The Soul is then in good case, and when it wakes again, finding it self at liberty and free, may easily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to God. We find the greatest part of the <hi>Psalms</hi> were composed by <hi>David,</hi> in or for the night. I will Bless the Lord, saith he, who hath given me warning, my Reins also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct me in the night season: <hi>Ps.</hi> 16. he assures us in the 6 <hi>Ps. That he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Couch with Tears;</hi> and the Spouse saies, <hi>By night in my Bed, I sought him whom my Soul loveth.</hi> And History tells us that St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> the Father of Monks and Hermits, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained very often of the Suns return, and in such words as these, very near, <hi>O Sun, why dost thou trouble the repose and quiet of my Soul? Why dost thou rise so early, to part me from the Bosom of my God? Why dost thou come to steal and deprive me of the sight of my true Sun,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>The measure of the Love of God is to have neither bounds nor measure, but to conclude in it every degree of Love. The true rule for hours of Devotion, is to give God all of them. 'Tis this, my Soul, that thou shouldst do, but canst not: for thou draggest after thee a fleshly prison that will not let thee. Thy affections cannot so far be subdued; thou art subject even to those necessities that will not suffer it: but oh, how happy wilt thou be, when thou shalt be in place, where all thy hours may be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thy Creator and Redeemer! there, free from all thy Chains of Flesh, thou mayst serve in perfect freedom the Father of Spirits. Now thou dividest thy time betwixt thy Occupations, thy Diversions, thy Meals and thy Devotions: But there this differing power shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and make but one business. Thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual charge shall be to sing Gods Praises, and to Contemplate on his Glory. Thy Meat and Drink shall be to do the Will of thy Father which is in Heaven. Thy Pleasures and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions shall be to possess, by a most intimate Enjoyment, God, who is the source of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Thou shalt then have no hours of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, for that fourth part shall be confounded
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42872:181"/> with the rest. Thou shalt be all fire, and all flame in Gods Service, and therein shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sift thy Sovereign happiness. Wouldst thou then here below, approach to the Glories of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice? multiply and continue as much as thou canst thy Commerce and Communications with God. If thou wert still with him, he would be still with thee, and where God is, is Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice be sure. VVhen thou entrest thy Closet with devout dispositions, God enters with thee, and after him, a Crowd of Angels, Cherubin and Seraphim. For the Lord encampeth with his Angels round about them that fear him. Surely there is not a more charming Object for the Angels that seek the Salvation of Men, than to see a truly Devout Person fall with his Face upon the Earth, bathing his Couch and Bosom with his Tears, sending up ardent sighs to Heaven, fixing his Eyes where his Heart is, and lifting up pure Hands to God, and longing to possess him. There is joy in Heaven over one Devout Soul, as there is over one Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul. And Heaven does as it were des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, and come to this Blest Spectacle. O labour therefore, O my Soul, to be continually in the Exercise of Devotion, as in that of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that Heaven may rejoice, and God come after to thee. By these so frequent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, thou wilt become as bright as
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42872:182"/>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> his Face. The Rays of this divine Sun, will pierce, and clear thee, will dissipate all Clouds and Darkness from thee, and melt that Ice and Coldness that makes thee negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and careless. By frequently contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating on him, thou wilt become his Mirror, and be transformed in the same Image, from Glory to Glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>

                     <p>Sun of my Soul, I seek thee with all my might; O hide not thou thy Face from me, nor suffer an Eclipse: Scatter these Clouds that cover thee, that separate thee from me, and rob me of thy Light. My sins, I must acknowledge, raise continually thick, filthy, malignant Vapors, that may form gross Clouds, and these Clouds produce the Storms and Tempests of thy severe Iustice, if thou wouldst pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me as I deserve: But, O my God, hinder henceforth the rising of these Vapours and drain the Source of them; Let my Heart be no more as a marish Ground full of standing and corrupt waters: But let it be a pure
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42872:182"/> and living Spring; let it be no more a cursed Field abounding in poisonous Herbs, but fertile of Flowers and Fruits of Life; and let from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to thee sweet fragrant Vapours, and benign Exhalations of Prayers and giving of Thanks, that may send forth an Odour of sweet Savour and Appeasment; and let these gentle Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours change into sweet Dews, and thy Grace, falling on my Soul, as stain upon a thirsty Land, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh it, and make it green and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the works of Righteousness. Thou art my Light; enlighten me in the Darkness of the Night, when I invoke thee from my Bed. Come, honour me with thy Presence, whilst all other Objects are away, that I may possess thee solely, and nothing may deprive my Soul of thee. Grant that the sweetness of this Ioy may spread it self in my Eyes, and diffuse a Heavenly sparkling, and an Holy gaiety over my Face that may not leave me all the Day, but keep me from all the Perplexities and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to which I am exposed: Let me lie down at Night as in thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42872:183"/> and throw my self into thine Arms, and fear nothing that is or can be dreadful in the Night.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Second particular Advice, is Solitude, and Holy Assembling together.</head>
                  <p>ONe may see, without any very great insight, that Devotion requires Solitude. We have our Lords Decision in the case, When thou wouldst pray, enter into thy Closet. They were strange Prayers those of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> in corners of the streets, and publick places: Our Lord had reason good to accuse them of Hypocrisie; but Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is not only necessary to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Pomp and Ostentation, which God in all things hates, but especially in Devotion; but also to the end that Prayer may be pure and well made.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42872:183"/> By what means, I pray, should a Soul recollect it self, where a thousand sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Objects set upon, and draw you out? we must therefore put it in a place of surety from them. Let us retire our selves never so far from the World, we shall carry enough of it along with us: And the Ideas of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will sufficiently persecute us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our voluntary exposing our selves unto those Objects. Yes, yes, the Communications of a faithful Soul with God, require a secret place. <hi>God is that Spouse,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Bernard, who bestows not his favours in Crouds, nor exposes them to the sight of men, but loves the Shade, and a Retirement. I held him and would not let him go, till I had brought him into my Mothers house, and into the Chamber of her that conceived me;</hi> 3. 4. When we have any design, that requires application and attention, we seek Retirement that we may not be distracted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: we should seek it also for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion as much, since nothing in the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42872:184"/> World requires attention more. The truly devout should be always far from Witnesses and Lookers on and entirely at their liberty. Devotion has its words and actions of its own: it impresses on the Soul its Transports and Motions, and the Body oft-times intervenes and mixes its, and this should not be exposed to the sight of men that may make wrong Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If these Reasons had any need of being supported with Examples, we have that of our Lord Jesus, to whom the Mountains seemed not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate enough to pray on, without the darkness of the Night adjoining to them. That of <hi>Daniel, who shall shut his Chamber-door upon himself at Prayer.</hi> That of Saint <hi>Peter, who went up to the top of the house to pray;</hi> but this is so much beyond dispute, that 'tis not necessary to add any more.</p>
                  <p>The necessity of <hi>Solitude</hi> or Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may afford us larger Prospects yet. There have been a great many Men, and I believe a great many
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42872:184"/> Saints that have looked upon <hi>Solitude</hi> and Devotion as inseparable, and that not only for some few hours of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, but even for our whole Lives. 'Twas this Opinion that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled heretofore the Wilderness of <hi>Thebais,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> with so many so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Hermits. They fled from the World to raise their Souls more easily to God, and acquire a Habit of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purer and more ardent. And hence may come the Christian Name of <hi>Devotion</hi> from these Peoples devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves in so particular a manner unto God. It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pronounce definitively upon this Life: I would not condemn all that have followed it, nor doubt but some of them were led, like our Saviour, by the Spirit into the Desart. But I may safely say this Life is subject to as many Tentations as that of the World. 'Tis in my judgment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming too far upon ones own strenth, to expose ones self alone to the Assaults of so powerful an Enemy
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42872:185"/> as the Devil. In Company, if one falls, another takes him up, but in the Wilderness one must support himself. And all will be little enough, to be ones own Pastor, Conductor and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, and he that thinks himself sufficient for them all, has too too good an Opinion of his own Forces. I desire to say no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this sort of Life, than S. <hi>Basil,</hi> a mighty Admirer himself of it, hath said: He believes this Life is not more Charitable than Prudent; either one is in the state of giving or of receiving Aid; if one has need of receiving Aid, 'tis certainly imprudence to confine your self to a Place, where you can have none; if you can give it others 'tis want of Charity, to deprive Society of your Assistance. He hath reason to say, that 'tis to deprive ones self of the hopes of Hearing, one day from our Lords Mouth these words <hi>Thou hast fed the hungry, given drink to the thirsty, cloathed the naked, and visited the sick, and in prisons.</hi> In
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42872:185"/> word, I am afraid this Fathers observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very true, that this life is so far from being the way to Humility, that 'tis a Ladder of Pride: for these men comparing themselves with themselves, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, think they are perfect. Every man looks too near, to know himself very well, or well enough to mend himself. Therefore a <hi>Solitary</hi> that examines himself by no bodies Eyes but his own, lets scape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a great many Faults, which any, but such partial Judges as we are to our selves, would never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Nay, so far may this Life be from being useful to Devotion, that I believe it may be prejudicial to it, because it deprives the Soul of the helps that the practice of Charity and works of Mercy minister undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to it. A man in the Desarts has his Distractions too, and unless his Soul be of an extraordinary make, they may be, 'tis to be feared, more dangerous than those of the World.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42872:186"/> A Mind left to it self, without any guide, commits strange Oversights. Great Business and great Solitude are two very dangerous Extremes; and an extraordinary share of Grace is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary both in one and the other Case: and therefore those that have receiv'd of God but indifferent gifts, should chuse a Life betwixt these two Extremes. But at least it is without dispute, that <hi>Solitude</hi> is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary at times that are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Devotion: which yet must not be taken or understood to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of publick and holy Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings at Church. They have their use for Devotion, and one must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deprive ones self of so necessary a help to Devotion, as publick Prayers are, under pretence of our Closet-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. 'Tis true, that every where besides, the Senses are Enemies to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection; but here both Senses and Imagination, favour the movements of a pious Soul. The sight of the Churches which are Gods Houses;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42872:186"/> the presence of the Angels who, we know, are assisting there; the Society of a multitude of Souls, that unite their Vows with their Voices; the Word of God that Ecchoes in their Ears; the Prayers that unite, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived by many Hearts, make up but one Address. All these things, I say, extremely help a Soul to make its Elevations, and often serve, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish from the Mind the Ideas of these earthly things, and substituting in their stead the good and holy ones. 'Tis not impossible to preserve <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> even in the midst of such a Croud as this. The devout Soul, in this state, is recollected in its self, so that no outward worldly Objects can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it or distract it. It is then in the Closet of its Heart, and has but one door open to the Word of God, and to things that may forward his Devotion: but all are shut upon those Objects of Vanity, that too often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb those holy Places and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. <hi>There is,</hi> saith St. <hi>Bernard, a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:42872:187"/> spiritual as well as corporal Solitude,</hi> and he that is free from vain and idle Thoughts is alone, though in the midst of a Croud of People: but 'tis a terrible profanation of this Temple, to carry to it indevout Dispositions, to have the Heart open to all sorts of Vanities, to go to see and to be seen, to hear, to find fault, and catch at Syllables and Sentences. These men have a great Account to give: 't had been enough to have offended men, and God too, all the Week besides, and not to come and bid him Battle, as it were, on Sunday too. I will not enlarge here so, upon the manner of Devotion in those places; my Design being only to lay down Rules for the Devotion of the Closet.</p>

                     <p>Where shall I find some blessed Solitude, to fly to, from the persecutions of my Souls E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? If I go out of the VVorld, I carry it with me: if I go into my Closet, I am pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued with a thousand wicked Thoughts, that cruelly persecute me: if I would save my self in the VVilderness, and dwell in Rocks and Caves with Mewes and Cormorants; there I should meet with Vultures, piercing Cares and Troubles, that would continually prey upon my very Inwards. I should be set upon by a whole Flock of Birds of light and vain Thoughts that would transport me from my self, and plunge me in the VVorld again. VVhat shall I do to remedy this mighty Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief? Thou knowest, O my God, tkough I do not; O let it be thy VVill to teach me! There is here no Port, to cover me from these rough Tempests, no Charms to drive away these Devils, and conjure down these Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of my Imagination: I must therefore get a new Heart, for 'tis not so much the worlds Fault, as 'tis my own; 'Tis not that it pursues me, but that I have fix'd it in my Heart, and carry it along with me whitherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I stir. If my Heart were clean and pure, I
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42872:188"/> might find Solitude, in the midst of Cities and populous Assemblies. My Soul might be collected in its self, and environ'd on all sides as with a Rampart, by the contempt of the things of the VVorld: the love of God and Goodness, would guard all Avenues, and drive from thence all interrupting Objects, and I should be as in a place of strength and great security.</p>

It must needs be, that thou, my God, shouldst have a mind to free me from my Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but I am still the same, and what am I the nearer?

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Third particular Advice for the Help of Devotion; Meditation, and Reading.</head>
                  <p>THE Soul of Man comes into this World at least as Ill-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Affairs of Grace, as of those of Nature. It is in all respects, a <hi>Rasa tabula,</hi> a meer Blank, and hath need of being fill'd with every thing: it easily acquires the knowledge of what is necessary to the subsistance of its life; because those Lights are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd by the Senses, and because those Objects are of its reach: but it hath need of greater strength, to attain to that knowledg that concerns the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42872:189"/> Life, because those Objects are disproportioned to its force: and yet these Notices are absolutely necessary to the practice of Vertue, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the practice of Devotion. This last Vertue is made up of Love and Zeal, but our Love is proportioned always to our Knowledge. I know not therefore of what nature those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are that are destitute of all Light and Knowledge, and are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly by the Senses. They are, it may be, the weaknesses of Tempers, rather than the effects of Grace; These Devotions of the Ignorant are almost always superstitious, and gross, and fix themselves on sensible Objects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in true Religion, all is intelligible and divine. The Objects of their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, is commonly an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> a Relique, or an Image: and God, that should be the only Object of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, hath hardly any share there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. I do not require our Christian should be learned, or should have dived into the secrets of Nature, or search
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42872:190"/> too curiously and exactly in the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Grace: I hold it rather prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to Devotion: but the devout Soul must yet be spiritual enough to raise it self above the Senses by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Meditation is an excellent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Soul, by which it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates through the superficies of Objects, and goes to the very bottom of the Heart; 'tis a reflex Action, that rolls its Subject up and down the Heart, to make some good impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on it: 'Tis a blessed View, in which the Soul discovers every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, some great thing or other, in what she is about-: but these Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are not curious Speculations, to communicate to others, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sentiments, and Applications that the Soul makes, and which are only for her. One cannot doubt but this is of absolute necessity to Devotion; for the Soul can entertain a Subject no farther than Meditation will let it pass. Devotion is a vigorous lively motion of the Soul, by which
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42872:190"/> we raise our selves to God, as to our sovereign Good; and therefore the more Meditation applies us to this great Object, and lets us see the source and bottom of his Goodness, the more ardent becomes our Devotion. So that this ought to be the principal Subject of our Contemplations. God is good, both in himself, and with respect to us. In himself, because he is great, powerful, majestick, debonaire, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and merciful: and though we should have no share in these divine Vertues, and their effects, yet God would nevertheless possess them, and consequently would be infinitely aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. One cannot think too often on these Vertues of God; 'tis one of the most powerful means that <hi>David</hi> used to awaken his sleeping Devotion: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken thou my Tongue,</hi> saith he, and thereupon falls on to chanting out the power of God in his Works, his Majesty that shines forth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, his Justice in his Judgments, his Wisdom in his government of Men,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42872:191"/> and his Clemency towards them. But because Interest hath such a share with us in all our Considerations, we must also join the consideration of Gods Favours and Benefits; We must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the depths of his Love, and consider him reconciling to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the World through Christ Jesus: We must try to dive into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Mercy that appears in all places, and in every part of the work of our Salvation: but above all we cannot sufficiently stay our thoughts upon rhe Passion of our Lord Jesus. There we may find a thousand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects capable, of softning the Soul; for the love of God appears in that, in all its Strength, and with its full Extent. From general considerations, it is good to come to particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. We must conceive how much we owe to God, for having disingaged us from so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, to raise us to so many glorious Hopes. In a word, the Object of our Meditation is as vast and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:42872:191"/> as God and all Nature and Grace together; for there is no Flower from whence we cannot gather Hony: we need not therefore fear to exhaust our thoughts, in a Subject of such vast Extent. Whence comes it then, our Meditations are so often dry, and our Recollections so exceedingly barren; not from the Seed, but from the bad Ground? <hi>Whence comes it,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Basil, that our minds find themselves so destitute of good Thoughts, as though there were nothing, that God is pleased withal, that can entertain us?</hi> It comes not from any thing but the Souls Negligence, for the Subject is inexhaustible; and if the Eye cannot find an end of the wonderful Things it sees, how much less the Mind of what it conceives? If the Eyes cease to see the light, when it is day, 'tis not because the light is out, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the sight is hindred. If thou openest, and turnest up a whole Field with Plough, it will return thee a plentiful Crop, otherwise it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42872:192"/> quite barren; and if thou diggest deep enough thou shalt come to springs of living Water: So if thou turnest over this great Subject, God and his Works by deep and frequent Meditations, there will flow out sources of Consolations and Instructions: and make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to repass over and again, the same Subjects, to the end thou mayst make them familiar. Our Soul is depending on the Body, whilst we live here on Earth; and the most spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ideas are formed in us, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Motions. It is therefore very useful, to pass and repass over with our selves, the thoughts of heavenly things, to the end we may give the Animal spirits a tendency and bent to that side; and thence it will come in time, that they will naturally flow that way. So that without designing it, we often shall think good thoughts. I will say one word yet, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of those Souls that are neither ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of penetration nor of great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: and that is, that they should
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42872:192"/> not be much afflicted if they find not themselves strong enough to carry these Reasonings so far as we have been advising to, and if Conceptions fail thee, be not dismaid, provided these things proceed not from Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Short but frequent Meditations (by which an ordinary good Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects and makes applications to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Author of its Salvation, and his Favours,) may stand in stead of long Reflections when one is out of case of making them.</p>
                  <p>To the Aids of Meditation, we must certainly call in, the reading of good Books; for we must not think to draw all from our own selves: and amongst these Books, the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are as much Superiour to the rest, as God is to Man, and the Sun to Stars of the sixth Magnitude. It is this Word that is strong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and sharper than a two edged Sword: it is that Fire that heats us inwardly, and makes us say, <hi>does not our heart burn within us?</hi> One pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42872:193"/> of St. <hi>Paul (Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in Chambering and wantonness, not in strifes and envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but put ye on the Lord Jesus)</hi> compleated the Conversion of Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> In every Page of Scripture we shall find Gods Favours, Graces, and precious Promises so proper to awaken our Devotion. There we shall find Models enough for holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proper to raise the Heart, and guide us in our own. Above all, the Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> is an inestimable Treasure for devout Souls. And tho we should refine upon all the Antients have said, yet we can never say e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of it. It were to be wish'd this Treasure might be all entire within our Memories, that we might every moment repeat some Lesson of it to our Heart. We should, if it were possible, habituate our Minds so to conceive its Thoughts, and form its Meditations, that all might be done in such terms as the holy Spirit uses in that Book.</p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:42872:193"/>
                  <p>To the reading holy Scripture, 'tis well to join also the reading of other good Books: and I will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon give an Advice that certain good Men have found beneficial: and that is to chuse out Lessons and Chapters of Devotion, such as have affected you, and to return frequently to them, that the Heart may get a custom of being affected at their sight. 'Tis the ordinary course of most men to join certain motions of Heart to certain Images, so that as soon as the Images present themselves to the mind, the motions arise within the Heart. For Example, if a Man has run some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hazard at any time in a Wood, the Image of a Wood shall hardly ever strike his imagination, but his Heart shall be agitated by Fear. So our Hearts being once moved, at the reading some pious Discourse that has affected it lively, will never fail to be moved at the presence of those same Thoughts, provided we read them with devout intention, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42872:194"/> with design to be affected. I compare this to that which happens to bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dogs, that presently leave off, as soon as they hear the Voices that they know. So the Heart being made familiar to godly Thoughts, that have often touched it, will feel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the same Movements when those Thoughts come upon him: for 'tis not with sacred and holy Lectures, as 'tis with profane ones: these here please the first Reading, but little the second, but never bear a third. The same thing may happen upon reading a Book of Devotion, when read for Divertisement, to see the neatness of the Phrase, the beauty of Thoughts, or the like; This way of Reading af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects not the Heart, but the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Will never endure a second Trouble. This Thought discovers to us a Mystery sufficiently obscure, namely, why the same thing affects one man extremely, but never touches another: it is from hence, that all men read not with the same disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42872:194"/> nor with the same intensions. A Preacher that would speak an hour upon a Subject of Piety, will read Books that will instruct him therein; but if he has not a Soul himself truly devout, and naturally so, will never be affected, because he comes not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with intention to be affected, he only seeks for matter to fill up his hour. Our Heart does very near what we would have it do; so that good Readings, that they may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Devotion, must be done with a very devout design and purpose, without which no great success can be looked or hoped for.</p>
                  <p>But as much as Devotion is aided by the reading good Books, so much is it prejudiced by the reading bad ones. 'Tis a great shame to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that it suffers the setting out and reading such bad Book, with more impunity and ease, than ever Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism it self did, though at the height of its corruption. This Age, and in particular, this Nation, may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42872:195"/> branded with Infamy, for this swarm of wicked, foolish Novels and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, which the effeminacy of our Hearts, the corruption of our Souls, and the craft of the Devil, have brought into the World. We must needs be great lovers of Lies, when fifty years have produc'd more Fables, than six thousand years have brought forth Histories: and the Church must be very corrupt to suffer it, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner authorise those shameless producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so full of unclean, impure imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Every devout Soul should have the reading of these things in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, for nothing certainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves and weakens the Heart like it. I grant we may not fall into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of this mischief by those Books, nor be corrupted into true real Disorder by these false Examples. But this at least is certain, that the Mind returns from reading these mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Books, fill'd with such cursed Images as drive away, and grieve the holy Ghost, and are absolutely
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42872:195"/> incompatible with the Spirit of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>If thou art ignorant, my Soul, of things that regard thy Salvation▪ 'tis wholly thy own fault: Thy God opens two great Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine Eyes, where thou mayst be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wondrous things of Heaven, and thy Salvation. I have often cast mine Eyes on Nature, Heaven, Earth, Mountains, Rivers, Fields and Forests: I have often fixed my Eyes upon the Heaven and its great Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the stars. But I own, to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, that these Temptations were all barren, they were done carelesly, without attention and without reflexion: Do therefore, O my Soul, what thou hast hitherto never done well, and as thou shouldst: Look on the Heavens and their vast Extent, and acknowledg the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Workman, his power, his wisdom, and his might: see how he hath made it as it were his Task, to depaint himself in all places, and leave the Traces of his steps, where-ever he hath passed. Look on the Sun, that spreads about such heat, and which men call the <hi>Lamp of the World:</hi> 'tis the Image of thy God that is light himself, the spring of life is in him,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42872:196"/> and in his light do we see light. This innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitude of lights, that shine in the Firmament, are the Emblems of those glorious Souls that shine in the heaven of the Blest. The swiftness of those vast prodigious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines that roll above my head, should make thee, O my Soul, think on the mighty Arm, that gives them life, and impresses Motion on them: the evenness and justness of these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preach the wisdom and regularity of Gods Actions, who does nothing but what is just and reasonable: the magnificence of the visible Heavens, may without trouble, lead thy Meditation to the thoughts of another life, and give thee some conception of the Glory God hath prepar'd for thee in Paradise. These visible Heavens, so fair and so magnificent, are but the Porch and entry of that Palace, where God hath designed thee an everlasting Mansion. How stately and how noble must the House then be, my Soul, whose Avenues and Entries are so rich and pompous? If from the heavens thou steppest into the Airs, that are the Regions of Storms and Tempests, Rains and Dews, in the last thou wilt see see the Emblems of the Grace of God, and in the first thou wilt see the Instruments of his VVrath, and the Messengers of his Vengeance. The one will lead thee to the meditation of his
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:42872:196"/> Justice, and the other to the consideration of his mercy. If thou descendest to the Earth, thou wilt there discover, round about thee, an incredible number of Objects of all sorts, that will instruct thee severally: Some speak to thee of God, his Wisdom and his Power, as well as those of the Heavens: Others declare thy weakness and thy Vanity, and talk of Death, and the necessity thereof, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of humane Affairs, and an hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lessons. But all this is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with the Knowledge thou shalt get from the reading that other Book that God hath dictated to his Prophets and Apostles: in that, thou wilt see, my Soul, the Abysses of divine Wisdom, the infinity of his Love, and the depths of his Mercy. But without wading too far in these Depths, what fruit may we not bring back from meditating on our Saviours Death, and Contemplation of his Cross? There thou wilt learn, my Soul, how thou shouldst love, for that's the school of Love: There thou wilt see thy heavenly Saviour, consumed with the Zeal of Gods House, and burning with the flames of Charity. He loved so the VVorld, that he gave himself to death for it, but 'twas a cruel Death too, the shameful and the painful one, the death of the Cross. He expos'd himself to all Arrows of Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42872:197"/> he drunk up all the dregs, and bore the whole weight of his indignation; and for whom, even for his Enemies. 'Tis thus, my Soul, that we must love. And this is but a little part, of what may be learn'd in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Book.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The Fourth particular Advice, to help Devotion: Prayer.</head>
                  <p>I Design not here to make an Elogy of Prayer, nor set forth all its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Use: both Antients and Moderns have done it at large: I will only say, 'tis one of the surest means to purifie the Soul, because there is nothing, by which we approach so near to God: there is no time, when he communicates himself more freely to us: He hath often been observ'd, to have given his extraordinary Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to Men amidst their Prayers. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in praying fell into an Extasie: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the third Heaven: <hi>Cornelius</hi> at his Prayers had the Vision of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel: Saint <hi>Monica,</hi> Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after so many Prayers and Tears for the Salvation of her Son, received in a Dream, that excellent Revelation
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42872:198"/> of his Conversion, an Angel telling her, <hi>Afflict not thy self, for thy Son is with thee.</hi> As God is the Sun of our Soul, when he throws his Rays di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly on our Hearts, he needs must both enlighten them, and warm them; he must needs dissipate the Vapors of the lower part, and leave his Image there. Now this Communication of the Rays of his Grace is never more bestowed than in Prayer. I will not enlarge, upon examining the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with which Prayers should be made, to be devout: we know well enough they must be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, persevering and ardent. I will only advise two things, the one to avoid Lassitude or Weariness, the other Distraction: First then, I say, few Souls are capable of long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for to make up a Prayer wholly devout, there must be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary application of Soul, an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Elevation, and an entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 chunk">
                        <desc>…</desc>
                     </gap>fastning from this World. Now these things do a kind
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:42872:198"/> of Violence to the Soul, that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclines to Relaxation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot last long; and if you will not give the Heart this Relaxation, it will take it in spight of your teeth, and fly out: I would therefore have Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions long, but divided into little spaces, that may make up several parts, and each of them short. Devotion is made up of three principal Exercises, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reading and Prayer, I would not have each of these Exercises performed altogether, one immediately after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but at several times, at little distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: We must indulge something to the weakness of the Soul, and keep it from disgusting by diversity. A little read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be the first step of Elevation, and a little Meditation on that reading will raise the Heart a step higher; and after that a short Prayer will bring it to the top. After which it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to Reading, Meditation and Prayer in the same order. In Prayer the Soul will fly into the Air by the strength of its own Wings; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42872:199"/> to Reading will do as those Birds that, when weary of flying, sit down and rest themselves, but not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground, but on some very high Tree. Our Soul in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will rest it self, not by falling on the ground, for it will never set its foot there, or suffer it self to return to the World, but will keep up aloft, and rest upon the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> will support it up, and lift it towards Heaven; and taking thence its flight, will rise by little and little upon the Wings of Meditation, till it return again by Prayer, whence it first set out. This Method will afford it time, to take its breath, and recover its Forces: One cannot last long, when all his strength is put forth; but by taking breath, and marching fairly, from time to time, one may go a great way in a day.</p>
                  <p>The other Advice I would give, respects those, who not being versed in, or much used to the Operations
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:42872:199"/> of the Soul, are less fit for great Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: These persons commonly perform their Exercises of Devotion by Heart; a way from which Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are almost inseparable. I would advise them therefore, to unfix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a while, and meddle not with Words, but attend only to the Sense: I do not mean they should do this in their Family-prayers or publick ones, I know very well that all the World has not the gift of Thinking, and putting those Thoughts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into Words that are proper and edifying to the Publick: but for the Devotions of the Closet, they should be rather from the Heart, than Tongue. When the Imagination makes no attempt to bring out Thoughts, or for the choice of Words, but goes on in a Road without any fear of losing it self, it seldom fails of stepping out, and calling some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by the way, as having little to do in the place you would have it stay in; but when it must attend to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42872:200"/> the manner of expressing fitly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Heart, the Heart and Imagination then joining their Forces make up the Attention compleat. I can't endure to hear say, that all the World is not capable of composing: all are not indeed capable of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing for Men, but for God they are. Let us try to do never so well, we shall but lisp, as it were, before God: and the most Eloquent Tongue in Nature is, if compared with the most Tongue-tied person in the World, but just as one Infant to another, with respect to God. God hears and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands all Tongues and Styles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: He asks for neither Order, nor Elegance, not he: the most confused Thoughts, that rise in Crouds from the Heart, are often what he likes best. He understands the silent Sighs; and knows what we would have, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we neither can speak, nor hardly conceive what 'tis we mean. <hi>For the Spirit of God,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, maketh intercessions for us, with groans
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42872:200"/> that cannot be uttered.</hi> After all, there are none but know very well what 'tis they want, and consequently none but what can pray: for Prayer is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Chain or composition of Desires of what we want, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Life, and that to come. The Passions are Eloquent, and the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination heats with the Heart, by sympathy: And hence it comes, that such as excuse themselves for want of Light, and Invention, when once they are in Wrath, never want words to express and shew themselves. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if the Heart were heated by the fire of Devotion, the Imagination would quickly find it out, and feel it, and never would complain of want of Matter both for Thought and for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>

                     <p>Thou hast never rightly understood, my Soul, how far thy God hath honoured thee, in suffering thee to throw thy self at his feet; thou art not sensible of this Favour: nay thou believest, that God is, in a manner, thy Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for humbling thy self before him: Thou never remembrest, that Audiences are very dear and rare, even with our earthly Princes, that are themselves in Gods sight but very shadows and meer Nothings. The King of Kings, will lend thee his Ear, will hear thee, will help thee, and his Throne is accessible every minute; thou needest not, to make thy entrance, either Credit, or Favour, or Friends, or pitiful sollicitings, nor any troublesom Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances. And yet how great this Throne, how great his Glory and Magnificence? God sits thereon, encircled with a Light, whose lustre dazzles even the Eyes of Seraphims: Round him are thousands and ten thousands of Angels and Arch-Angels, prostrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before him: On his right hand are Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Pleasures to delight his Children in; On his left Torrents of Fire, to consume his Enemies: On one side, Hell and Death, and all the dreadful Executioners of Wrath and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42872:201"/> Vengeance: on the other, Heaven and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, with all the glorious Recompences God hath prepar'd for those that love him. Thou seest not this, my Soul, and therefore thou art but little affected: but thou must needs believe it, although the Veil of the Flesh at present hinder thee from seeing it. Represent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thy self, the magnificence of that Throne, admire, and tremble, and acknowledge with thanks, that though thou art corrupted, O my Soul, by the Commerce thou hast with a wretched Body, abiding in a house of Clay, having thy seat in the Dust, as thou truly hast; thou art yet at liberty, to present thy self each moment before that God, who sitteth upon the Cherubims, and flieth upon the wings of the Wind, <hi>who maketh his Angels Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and his Ministers a flame of fire.</hi> Thou hast permission to pray to him, my Soul, but alas, thou knowest not how, and that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou canst not love. One never wants something to say to a beloved Friend: when ones Heart is entirely opened to any one, and one is permitted to pour himself into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, one never hesitates, or stops short. Ah, if thou didst but perfectly love thy God, thou never wouldst be weary of entertaining him; thy Imagination never would be frozen, thy Tongue never be mute, and thou wouldst ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42872:202"/> want expression: thy Heart would spread abroad like a stream, and thy Prayers would roll about as flames: but thou languishest at thy Prayers, because thou speakest not to God, as to thy near Friend: the driness of thy Heart proceeds from the coldness of thy Affections, and thy want of Charity to God.</p>

Divine Spirit, who, in the beginning of the Creation, drewest the light from darkness, and order
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42872:202"/> from confusion; Stretch out thy Wings even now over the Chaos of my thoughts, and strike out Prayers from thence, well conceived, well form'd, and well digested: Thou makest the dumb to speak; Thou givest Eloquence to those that stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered: Touch my Tongue with a Coal from thy Altar, that my Lips may be thereby purified: open my Lips, and my Mouth shall shew forth thy praise: Warm thou my Heart, and fill it with good and pious Thoughts, that from its abundance my Mouth may speak.

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Fifth particular Advice; Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Mortification.</head>
                  <p>WE cannot deny, but Fasting and Mortification are very necessary Helps to Devotion, unless we will deny the Scriptures and the Maxims of the Fathers of the Church. The Scriptures seldom separate Prayer from Fasting; and to both of them together attribute Power of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the most dangerous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. <hi>This kind of Devil, goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.</hi> The Flesh is a rampant Horse, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not manage, but by plucking up the Reins: 'Tis a Lion that we cannot, nor must not, feed 'till he grows fat, if we would not have him grow wild,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42872:203"/> and endanger his falling upon us: The Body, if you observe it well, is this very Flesh of which the Scriptures complain so often, and so loud: of which it is said, that it is an Enemy to God, and its fruits, are Excesses, Insolencies, Murthers, Adulteries, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, Strifes, Envyings, Ambition and Avarice. To hinder these Fruits from growing, 'tis good to keep this Root dry: for if we water it with carnal Pleasures, it will shoot forth its cursed Branches, and will turn us out of the way of our Salvation. As Plants that grow apace, and surmount their Neighbours, keep them in evil state, by drawing from them all the good nourishment of the Earth; so the Flesh never thrives but to the Souls cost, which it still keeps in great driness of Consolations, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme barrenness of Fruits. A great Meal is but an ill preparation for an Exercise of Devotion: one cannot be in the Kitchin and the Closet at the same time; and whilst the Soul is in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42872:204"/> its Furnaces, seething, and digesting its Victuals, and distributing its Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about, it cannot stir abroad to places appointed for Meditation and Contemplation. There are still thick Clouds, and gross Vapours that are rising from the Stomach, that make the Heart unfit for any lofty flight or excellent Operation. <hi>Abundance of Delicates,</hi> said Saint <hi>Basil, send up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of fuliginous Exhalations, like Clouds, that darken, as it were, the Sun, and light which is caused in the Ʋnderstanding, by the holy Ghost:</hi> And therefore <hi>Moses,</hi> that he might Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon God, without any Cloud to interpose, continued forty days and nights, without either Meat or Drink, that the Superiour part of his Soul, might be free and disingaged from the trouble and obscurity of the inferiour Part. Ease and abundance make the sins of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities of Life are the effects of the mouths Excess. After high feeding, the Blood is enflamed, and that gives
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42872:204"/> life and disposition to all carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and an inclination to worldly Delights, which is always immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and knows no bounds nor end. The people sat down to eat, and to drink, and rose up to play. 'Tis therefore of absolute necessity, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Rules of Sobriety, and to nourish the Body no farther than is necessary to its well-being: We must give it what is necessary, and refuse it what is superfluous, that it may never be in a condition to rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. Nay, we must oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench its Necessaries to tame it the more: For the Flesh being humbled contributes much to the Contrition of the Heart; and the less a Soul is united to its Body, the easier it is to take its flight towards God. In Fasting, our Devotions are not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by sleep and drowsiness, nor corrupted by involuntary Movements, nor sullied by dishonest Thoughts.</p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:42872:205"/>
                  <p>But concerning Fasting, there are several things to be understood: First, We must not look upon it as a part of Devotion, and Worship, by which God is served; for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is not in Meats and Drinks, 'tis only a Help to Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and this consideration will help us to another, and that is, that we must not think that Fasting is any thing in itself, but only in the case of Devotion: For to fast when we Ride, or take a Journey, or in any of our Affairs, is a work of no great merit, nor of use. The first Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration will furnish us with a Third, and that is, that Fasting need not be us'd in Devotion any oftner than we find it helpful to us, or that we stand in need of it, and consequently one cannot give any certain Rules for its practice, or its continuance. There are some Tempers so weak, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is so far from being aiding to their Devotions, that it rather hurts them: because it throws the Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42872:205"/> a certain negligence and dulness, that hinders the Soul from raising it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Others there are, that cannot be subdued but by long Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and these should never spare themselves. Some are tamed more easily, and should get to understand themselves, but yet they must take heed, that the weakness of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers serve them not for a pretence to dispense, with their necessary Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
                  <p>But we cannot however approve the Cruelties, some exercise upon their Bodies, as upon declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, sparing neither Fire nor Sword. We will not meddle here with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, but leave every one to their own Conscience. We only say, that though these Excesses are not new or Modern, yet they are never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for all that. Church History, I know, supplies us with abundance of Examples, of excessive Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but I had rather keep to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> who cannot be
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42872:206"/> suspected in this Case, being a great Partisan and promoter of Fasting and Mortifications; Yet this Saint <hi>Basil</hi> repeats a great many times the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Mediocrity, and insists very much upon it: He forbids his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and his <hi>Solitaries</hi> to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in excessive Mortifications, and says in his <hi>Book of Virginity, That the burthen of the Flesh that is heavy and exceedingly bloated up, is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a hindrance to the raising up the Soul, than the feebleness of a body sick and macerated by a long Excessive Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification:</hi> and therefore he expresly orders, that Necessity be the Rule of Abstinence and Fasting.</p>
                  <p>Another piece of Advice that I would give on this Occasion, is, that Fasting and corporal Mortification strike not to the bottom of the Soul, nor mortifie all sorts of Sin. S. <hi>Basil</hi> says, <hi>That the Devil not being able to possess himself of a Soul tamed by great Mortifications, seizes on a Soul that is wholly naked, and by, and in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42872:206"/> and ends fleshly Desires.</hi> If the Soul, without the Body, is capable of committing corporal Sins in spight of all Mortifications, how should it cure it self by those means, of such Distempers as are entirely in it, such as are Envy, Pride, and Self-love? We know also these Passions reign with greater sway in the Souls of the men of Haircloth, Scourges, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerations than elsewhere. This War so cruel to the Body, and that seems a renouncing to all Self-love, is yet for the most part, but another sort of most delicate Self-love, that tends to Glory by extraordinary Ways, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it the more certainly. From all this, I conclude, that the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requires, when he bids us, <hi>Mortifie our Members which are upon Earth;</hi> and that which we have thought necessary to advise to, goes farther than bodily Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To stifle this Self-love, this Pride, these Jealousies, these Hatreds, Envyings, Avarice and Ambition,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42872:207"/> there is need of another kind of Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that is an abstaining from all such Actions as may feed and nourish those Vices. I conclude this Chapter and this Treatise, with the excellent Words of the oft-named Saint <hi>Basil, Take heed to thy self that thou definest not the Excellence of Fasting, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining only from eating, for a true Fast consists in abstinence from Sin. Thou eatest no Flesh, but thou devourest and tearest thy Neighbour: Thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stainest from Wine, but thou abstainest not from doing Outrage: Thou waitest for the Evening before thou wilt eat, but thou spendest the day in Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: Woe to them that are drunk, but not with Wine. Anger is the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness of the Soul, that sets it beyond and out of all Reason, as well and as much as Wine.</hi>

                     <head>MEDITATION.</head>
                     <p>'Tis a dangerous Drunkenness, that of VVine; I own it is: and an abominable Sin, the sin of Gluttony: they are great Enemies of Devotion; and therefore Fasting, Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Sobriety are very neressary, to the assisting and promoting it. But take good heed my Soul to thy own self, these Vices principally respect the Body. There is another Drunkenness, another Gluttony, that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately exercised by thee, and are it may be, much more dangerous. This Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Pride, this Gluttony is Covetousness and Ambition. How many Souls do I see drunk with the Vanities of this World, and a high Opinion of themselves! they are so exalted with Pride, that all this VVorld cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, so far they extend, and so high they raise themselves. This Drunkenness makes them make a thousand false steps, and a thousand stumbles. Their ways are all oblique and crooked, as the ways of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards truly are. They have always a great Opinion of themselves, and of their Wisdom, Power and Prudence: yet all this often fails
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42872:208"/> them: they reel up and down, and at last they fall. For Pride, says the Wise man, goes before a fall. Examine well thy self, my Soul, if thou art not tainted with this Evil, nor drunk with the thoughts of thy own Justness and Deserts. Alas, if thou deniest this, thou acknowledgest it. Ah, 'tis a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty piece of pride to think one is not proud; for 'tis to think you are as good indeed, as you esteem your self: but no man in the VVorld but esteems himself better than he truly is. Thou wilt say, it may be, that thou hast a very ill Opinion of thy self; but be thou sure, my Soul, thou dost not despise thy self, as much as thou art truly despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: but, if thou dost despise thy self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, thou makest a merit of that very thing, and art proud of thy own neglecting thy self. The other Vice of Glutony, the gluttony of the Soul, is no less dangerous. Thou seest men, my Soul, that devour and eat continually, and never say, it is enough; why, 'tis no otherwise with the Ambitious and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous that suck the substance of the poor; that eat the people of God, as it were bread: that labour with inconceivable greediness to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselves: that search the VVorld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and find no end of their desires, that mount to the highest pitch of Honour and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42872:208"/> Greatness, but cannot fill the depth of their Ambition. Take heed, my Soul, of launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to these Excesses. For he that is an hungred for Silver will never be satisfied therewith. Quench then the fire of thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, for if thou fillest them, thou feedest them; and they will eat thy very Entrails, and cause, it may be, such a flame as may consume thee, and thy Neighbours. I must not therefore neglect bodily Fasting, but the principal Fast is Humility, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve me from the drunkenness of Pride; and content of Mind, which will make me neglect all things superfluous, and be content with all things necessary. This is the true sobriety of the Soul, and these two Vertues go hand in hand. Be humble, O my Soul, and thou wilt be contented with thy Fortune, know but how little thou art good for, and thou wilt quickly be persuaded, that thou hast more than thou deservest.</p>

'Tis very sure that I am nothing, but yet I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess as much: my Mouth indeed says it, but my Heart agrees not thereto; and I still find within me the Devil of Pride, solliciting me, and saying softly to me, Fool that thou art; why dost thou speak thus vilely of thy self? If thou dost not prize thy self, who shall? Are other Men obliged to have a better Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thee than thou thy self hast; since thou shouldst know thy self the best? If I humble my self before thee, O God, 'tis because I look upon it as a thing of no Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Proportion betwixt my self and thee, being so infinitely great. But with Men I take other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; I endeavour to deceive them, and give them a great Opinion of me; I would keep my Rank, I

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Rash Judgment that is made against the Devout.</head>
                  <p>I Have given such Advice as I thought necessary to Devotion. But before I end, I believe, I owe a word of Consolation to such as are truly Devout, of whom there is so hard a judgment passed in the World. They are all of them commonly put into the rank of Hypocrites; they are false Devoto's, say the Prophane, that observe Forms so exactly, that are, found so constantly at the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Piety; that lend such atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Sermon, that Pray and Communicate with so many visible Tokens of Devotion; We are, say they, nevertheless good Christians for having less affectation; we have that which is solid in Piety, and others
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42872:210"/> have the appearances. We must own that Hypocrisie does a great deal of mischief to true Devotion. I do not deny but that there are abundance of false Devoto's. There is no Veil, with which evil Consciences do more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cover themselves, than that of Piety. But because there are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and false Religious, is it therefore necessary there should be no truly devout People? because there are false Diamonds and false Lights, are there no true ones of each kind? There are some that think they have found a good Remedy for this Evil: and that is, they affect an appearing neglect of Devotion; for having at the bottom some Zeal, they imagine it necessary to affect in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, a Style, and Air of indifference, to avoid the accusation of Hypocrisie. But this is to avoid one Evil by incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring another, and a greater. When we are brought to the necessity of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committing a fault our selves, or occasioning another to do so, we
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42872:211"/> must resolve upon the last. We are called to let our Light shine in good works before men, and to edifie our Neighbours by our good Examples. Woe to such as place the Candle under a Bushel. But to say truth, I believe that those that make it their business to hide their Devo- from us, hide no great matter from us, there is I doubt but a very little within. When a Chamber is one fire, the flames go out at the Windows. Devotion is a Fire, that throws its flames through every open passage, and nothing can hinder them. If the Heart be full of Zeal and Piety, it will appear upon the Tongue, in the Hands, and even in the Eyes. 'Tis true, we must avoid Affectation, God abhors those pompous Shews and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentations of Piety, that set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves forth at the Street corners, and are perfected by elevations of the Hands, turning the Eyes, and pale Countenances. The most secret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are always the best: but 'tis
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42872:211"/> very easie to distinguish Affectation from Sincerity. Did our prophane ones know themselves never so little, or understood but any thing, they would never confound a modest Piety, and sage Devotion, that shines not but from under the Veil of profound and true Humility, with a Devotion made up of Grimaces. The Lives and Manners of men are the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones of their Sincerity and Devotion. If a devout Person, be covetous, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, one that enriches himself at the expence of the Poor; a furious Man, a revengeful, or the like, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent he shall be put amongst the false Devotes. But if his life is in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects unblameable, 'tis a sin to be punish'd with all the flames of Hell, to judge that his Devotion is false and hypocritical: 'tis a kind of Sin against the holy Ghost, and like that of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> against our Lord, when they accused him of doing that by the help of the Devil, which he did by the Finger of God, and by his
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42872:212"/> Spirit. These prophane persons do the same thing, they attribute to the evil Spirit of Hypocrisie, the work of Gods Spirit. But, say they, if these Devoto's appear regular in their lives, it is because they have Art enough to conceal their naughtiness, the love of their Reputations engages them to such continued Precautions as take and keep from the Publick all manner of knowledge of them. But is not this to violate all sort of Rights, to invade even those of God himself, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to dive into the very Heart? Is not this to violate the Asylums of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie, to judge thus hardly, of what appears by no manner of thing in the World? Is it not to go against all the Rules of good Sense, to judge a man to be wicked, because he appears good? To conclude, I say, that if I were driven to declare for one, either the Hypocrite, or the profane <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> I should rather do it in favour of the first than second: the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite at least is half a Christian,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42872:212"/> tho he have the worser share of it. His Exterior is edifying, and his false Piety may kindle true in other Folks. But the <hi>Libertine</hi> has nothing good either within, or without. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends God, scandalizes his Neighbour, ruins his own, and other mens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I end therefore with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising our Religious to affect nothing; to take great heed, that he hide not his Devotion under the Veil of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to please the Prophane: that he be exact in frequenting holy Assemblies; to hear with Attention; to pray with Ardour; not to dispense with actions of Humility, but yet to do them with moderation: and after this, let him make an attempt to raise himself above the judgment of these, openly prophane People, and God that sees the sincerity of their Hearts, will recompence them, and punish most severely those rash Judges.</p>

                     <p>What an extravagant madness is it, more to fear the rash Judgments of Men, than the just ones of God? but yet my Heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches me with doing this. How often have I found in my self an inclination to do something good, and have been hindred by a wicked shame? I shun the being remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for my singularity, and therefore I am or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily just as the rest of the Croud. How oft was I enclin'd, to have said some good things, yet chose rather to attend to other Discourses, vain, or sinful? Nay, I not only attended to, but made up part of them my self. How often have I met with the profane, whose wicked words I had in true abhorrence, but yet I suffered and approved them by my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? How frequently have I condemn'd such and such Pleasures, in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I suffered my self to be afterwards engag'd? Curse on thee, O thou fatal dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stream of Custom! Who is there that is strong enough to withstand thee? O wilt thou never be drawn dry? How long wilt thou persist to drag by force the Sons of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42872:213"/>
                        <hi>Eve</hi> into this vast and perillous Ocean, where they can hardly save themselves, that get upon the Plank of Jesus Christ his Cross? Alas, my Soul; if thou art in the Croud, thou wilt perish with the Croud: thou wilt be nevertheless damn'd for going to Hell with company. The society and multitude of those accursed ones diminishes not their pains. Seek not therefore the approbation and the praise of Men at the expence of thy Conscience and Salvation: that is, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase wind and smoak, at much too dear a rate. VVhat signifies it to thee, what Men judge of thee, provided God, that sees thy Inwards, judges well? In the VVorld, sins carry away Rewards, and the brave Vices are commended: but comfort thy self, and be assur'd another Life will come, in which all shall receive what is their due. Then the rash judgments of Men shall be made void by Gods most Righteous one. Then Jesus Christ shall own and confess thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father and the holy Angels, and shall say, <hi>Come thou good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord:</hi> and then shall he, in sight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, of Men and Angels, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and condemn those rash and hard judgements of Men, that violate every day,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42872:214"/> that Law of Equity, <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Seek therefore, O my Soul, oh seek to be approv'd of God: walk before him, and be perfect, be not a slave to Custom: be not conformable to the evil Customs of this evil VVorld: think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually on him, before whose Eyes thou walkest continually, and who must be the Rewarder of all thy works, or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of all thy sins: get far from the society of the prophane, that thou beest not infected with their Contagion; and since thou canst not vanquish their ill Customs by thy good Examples, take heed their bad Examples vanquish not thy good Customs.</p>

I condemn all vain words and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and all bad Customs, that are far from Modesty, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, Sobriety, and from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Purity: But yet I let my felf go on. Take me, O Lord my God, my guardian and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting Angel, and lead me by thy good Spirit in this sharp, rough and difficult Passage. The World is a dangerous Sea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beaten with Storms and Tempests, and never calm; 'tis full of Banks and Rocks, famous for a prodigious Multitude of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42872:215"/> Wrecks. Lord Iesus Christ, be thou my Pilate: Blessed Spirit, be thou my North Star in this most perillous Voyage; that I may get out of these Depths that open their gaping Mouths to take me in. Enlighten me in this dark Night, that I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not; but leaving apart all those by-roads, though never so trodden and frequented by the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I may march on in the King's High-way, though it be never so deserted and unused. Let me go on in the Ways of Piety, of Righteousness and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which thou hast marked out; and, that in these safe ways, I may advance continually, and leave the World and Sin behind me: Let me tend to the Mark, to the Prize, to the Possession of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to which thou hast called me. O, my God, grant that I may arrive at last to that most Blessed Place, that Port, where I shall be safe covered from all Tempest; to that Heaven, where I shall see thy Face in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42872:215"/> where I shall be satisfied with thy Likeness; where I shall see thee without End, possess thee without Weariness, and shall be blessed to all Eternity. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
